Traditional approaches struggle to capture evolving attack patterns and handle high-dimensional data, highlighting the necessity for more sophisticated approaches. A neighbor-hood reconstruction-based smart grid attack detection scheme based on subgraphs is proposed. By leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), the challenge of capturing complex inter-dependencies among grid nodes is addressed. This approach employs unsupervised learning principles, training the model solely on normal data and utilizing the reconstruction error of node features to detect attacks. Additionally, by subgraph sampling and feature suppression, the model's ability to utilize neighborhood information is enhanced, thereby further improving detection effectiveness. Simulation results on IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus power system demonstrate the feasibility of the method, achieving a detection accuracy of 96.67% and 97.46%, respectively. © 2024 IEEE.","2024","2025-04-04 09:37:52","2025-11-26 09:20:38","","2657-2662","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-11-26] 0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/EEZGNKHB/Ren et al. - 2024 - A Neighborhood Reconstruction-Based Cyber Attack Detection Method for Smart Grid Security.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/ZF25MKV9/10832013.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/6CKP87UV/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/TJN3L4JM/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/2U3VEM3C/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/SQ3WWCHU/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/MASK3T7Y/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/MLQBZN29/Ren et al. - 2024 - A Neighborhood Reconstruction-Based Cyber Attack Detection Method for Smart Grid Security.ocr.pdf","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10832013&ref=; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10832013","#done; Power grids; Smart grid; Cyber attacks; Cyber-attacks; Smart power grids; Attack detection; Efficiency and reliability; Neighbourhood; Detection methods; Subgraphs; Enhanced efficiency; Smart grids security; Traditional approachs; #cybersecurity","Training; Unsupervised learning; Cyberattack; Power system stability; Feature extraction; Stability analysis; Simulation; Reliability; Smart grids; Security","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Conference Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Utilizing the SciGRID and GridKit datasets, consisting of 479, 16,167 nodes and 765, 20,539 edges respectively, the study employs K-nearest neighbor and median imputation methods to address missing data. Centrality metrics are integrated into a single comprehensive score for assessing node criticality, categorizing nodes into four centrality levels informative of vulnerability. This categorization informs the use of traditional machine learning (including XGBoost, SVM, Multilayer Perceptron) and Graph Neural Networks in the analysis. The study not only benchmarks the capabilities of these models in network analysis but also explores their potential in identifying critical nodes using features beyond centrality metrics alone, enhancing their applicability in real-world scenarios. The research addresses a significant gap in effectively assessing the vulnerability of electrical networks, marked by isolated use of traditional centrality metrics and a lack of integration between these combined metrics with both tradiational and advanced machine learning models. The study integrates various centrality measures into a comprehensive metric and advocates for the application of advanced machine learning models, particularly GNNs. It underscores the need for larger and more complex datasets to unlock the full potential of GNNs in network vulnerability assessments. By comparing the performance of GNN models with traditional machine learning approaches across datasets of different sizes and complexities, the study provides insights into optimizing model selection for network analysis, thereby contributing significantly to the field of network vulnerability assessment. © 2024, Binghamton University Libraries.

In the simplest setting, OPF determines how much power to generate in order to minimize costs while meeting demand for power and satisfying physical and operational constraints. In even the simplest case, power grid operators use approximations of the AC-OPF problem because solving the exact problem is prohibitively slow with state-of-the-art solvers. These approximations sacrifice accuracy and operational feasibility in favor of speed. This trade-off leads to costly ""uplift payments"" and increased carbon emissions, especially for large power grids. In the present work, we train a deep learning system (CANOS) to predict near-optimal solutions (within 1% of the true AC-OPF cost) without compromising speed (running in as little as 33--65 ms). Importantly, CANOS scales to realistic grid sizes with promising empirical results on grids containing as many as 10,000 buses. Finally, because CANOS is a Graph Neural Network, it is robust to changes in topology. We show that CANOS is accurate across N-1 topological perturbations of a base grid typically used in security-constrained analysis. This paves the way for more efficient optimization of more complex OPF problems which alter grid connectivity such as unit commitment, topology optimization and security-constrained OPF.","2024-03-26","2024-08-09 11:45:39","2025-06-15 19:46:20","2024-08-09 11:45:39","","","","","","","CANOS","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","8 citations (Semantic Scholar/arXiv) [2025-04-09] 8 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] arXiv:2403.17660 [cs]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/67FHZAZR/Piloto et al. - 2024 - CANOS A Fast and Scalable Neural AC-OPF Solver Ro.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/BJDXW3UW/2403.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/5YD2VKFJ/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/LTRA79X5/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/8QDMM9YR/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/8K246V3S/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/VSNSDVMC/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/6BHVH2E4/Piloto et al. - 2024 - CANOS A Fast and Scalable Neural AC-OPF Solver Ro.ocr.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.17660.pdf; https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17660","#done; #optimization-control","Computer Science - Machine Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2403.17660","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Systems are installed on rooftops, trackers, deployed with batteries, and in many other configurations. Virtual models of a system, called 'digital twins,' are often constructed to predict future performance, quantify losses, schedule O&M, etc. However, due to increasing system diversity and complexity, constructing these digital twins from traditional physical models (such as PVSyst or the Sandia Array Performance Model) can be quite time consuming, prone to modeler error, and tend to require detailed, expensive site-specific metadata. Therefore, models that can learn a representation of the system from data (called 'data-driven digital twins') can be used alongside or in place of traditional, end-to-end physics-based models. In this work, we present a comparison of a empirical digital twin (using pvlib-python physics-based models) and a data-driven digital twin (using spatiotemporal graph neural networks) and quantify error metrics for the models. It is found that data-driven models best represent the average case of a PV system, whereas the empirical model better corresponds to oscillation due to weather variation.

By introducing the proposed virtual node-splitting strategy, generator-level attributes like costs, limits, and ramp rates can be fully captured by GNN models, improving GNN's learning capacity and prediction accuracy. Optimal power flow (OPF) problem is used for real-time grid operations. Limited timeframe motivates studies to create size-reduced OPF (ROPF) models to relieve the computational complexity. In this paper, with virtual node-splitting, a novel two-stage adaptive hierarchical GNN is developed to (i) predict critical lines that would be congested, and then (ii) predict base generators that would operate at the maximum capacity. This will substantially reduce the constraints and variables needed for OPF, creating the proposed ROPFLG model with reduced monitor lines and reduced generator-specific variables and constraints. Two ROPF models, ROPFL and ROPFG, with just reduced lines or generators respectively, are also implemented as additional benchmark models.

In this paper, we combine Physics-Informed Neural Networks with both a Guided-Dropout (GD) Neural Network (which associates dedicated neurons with specific line connections/disconnections) and an edge-varrying Graph Neural Neural Network (GNN) architecture to learn the setpoints for a grid that considers all probable single-line reconfigurations (all critical N-1 scenarios) and subsequently apply the trained models to N-k scenarios.We demonstrate how incorporating the underlying physical equations for the network equations within the training procedure of the GD and the GNN architectures, performs with N-1, N-2, and N-3 case studies. Using the AC Power Flow as a guiding application, we test our methods on the 14-bus, 30-bus, 57-bus, and 118-bus systems.

Recently, Graph Auto-Encoders (GAE) based link prediction methods effectively integrate deep learning into link prediction tasks and attract much attention. However, the existence of a link between two nodes may be closely related to their neighboring nodes in different scales, when GAE-based encoding processes only extract features from the adjacency matrix at a single scale, establishing node features that account for varying influences from different neighborhood sizes becomes challenging. To alleviate this situation, this paper proposes a Multi-scales Hybrid Graph Attention Neural Network with Jaccard Correlation Embedding (MHGAT) to address link prediction tasks. Specifically, MHGAT enhances graph node features by integrating Jaccard Correlation, which reflects the neighboring information, as heuristic information. Then, it designs a multi-scale hybrid attention method for extracting link features around multiple neighborhoods for building a graph encoder to model the importance of nodes. By incorporating a designed node correlation-based graph auto-encoding loss, MHGAT extracts multi-scale neighboring correlation features and leverages these features for link prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to commonly used link prediction methods, the proposed MHGAT approach achieves superior performance. The experiments also validate the effectiveness of the designed multi-scale hybrid attention and node correlation embedding. © 2024 IEEE.","2024","2025-04-04 09:37:06","2025-11-25 20:38:53","","457-464","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/I8VLYX2T/Mai et al. - 2024 - Multi-Scales Hybrid Graph Attention Neural Network with Jaccard Correlation Embedding for Link Predi.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/43PHUGAM/10867197.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/SIASU7FQ/Mai et al. - 2024 - Multi-Scales Hybrid Graph Attention Neural Network with Jaccard Correlation Embedding for Link Predi.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/GNHUWV8S/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/K2BFSAPI/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/HIJ4QKYY/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/QWG2B5BC/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/SY2EWXVU/page-5.html","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10867197&ref=; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10867197","#done; Graph neural networks; Auto encoders; Neural-networks; Prediction models; Hybrid graphs; Embeddings; Prediction methods; Graph embeddings; Network embeddings; Multi-scales; graph attention neural network; graph auto-encoder; link prediction; Signal encoding; Graph auto-encoder; Graph attention neural network; Link prediction; Prediction tasks; #grid-analysis","Power grids; Deep learning; Correlation; Neural networks; Feature extraction; Security; Dispatching; Encoding; Buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2024 4th International Conference on Electronic Information Engineering and Computer Technology, EIECT 2024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In power systems and wireless networks, efficient link scheduling approaches commonly rely on deep reinforcement learning or greedy algorithms designed for maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) to solve scheduling conflicts. Greedy algorithms offer lower computational complexity, making them well-suited for our link scheduling tasks. However, these methods often analyze network topologies within a single scope, which could over-look configurations and conflicts across various regional and business scopes within link scheduling systems. In these systems, the neighborhoods of links across different scopes play varying roles in conflict relationships. To address this gap, this paper proposes a link scheduling algorithm: Multi-scope Spectral Graph Neural Network based MWIS solver (MSGNN-based MWIS solver). This approach integrates multi-scope spectral graph feature embedding to capture diverse network structures and conflict relationships across various neighborhood scopes. Moreover, MSGNN-based MWIS solver leverages reinforcement-based principles alongside greedy algorithms by introducing a reinforcement-based utility function to the MWIS solver. Specifically, the MSGNN-based MWIS solver operates by constructing a spectral space that transforms conflict relations across different scopes into correlation patterns among conflict graphs at various frequencies within a designed spectral graph neural network framework. This spectral graph neural network framework then utilizes spectral filters in different frequencies to extract link features and optimize conflict graph relationships. To keep the multi-scope spectral graph feature embedding effective, this MSGNN-based MWIS solver is optimized by a tailored loss function emphasizing consistency and the introduced utility function, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of the link scheduling. Experimental results validate the superiority of the proposed MSGNN-based MWIS solver for link scheduling over convention-al approaches, affirming the efficacy of constructed spectral filters in different scales and constructed consistence loss. © 2024 IEEE.","2024","2025-04-04 09:34:47","2025-11-25 14:02:49","","932-940","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/S8BQP5WF/Mai et al. - 2024 - Multi-Scope Spectral Graph Neural Network for Link Scheduling.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/CPVS4I72/Mai et al. - 2024 - Multi-Scope Spectral Graph Neural Network for Link Scheduling.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/NZL7IU2S/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/BUS2RG2M/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/9ED2TWT3/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/J2BXLRLY/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/5XBBZND8/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/HRPHE2MR/display.html; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10883477&ref=; https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000237855&origin=SingleRecordEmailAlert&dgcid=raven_sc_search_en_us_email&txGid=cbcb5c3125d0b5da6d0c98ab4c7d1cd1","#done; Graph neural networks; Graph neural network; Graph algorithms; Deep learning; Deep reinforcement learning; Reinforcement learning; Network theory (graphs); Graph embeddings; Network embeddings; Network frameworks; Conflict graph; Feature embedding; Graph features; Greedy algorithms; link scheduling; Link scheduling; Maximum weighted independent set; Scales (weighing instruments); Scheduling algorithms; Set solvers; Utility functions; #optimization-control","Technological innovation; Power system dynamics; Feature extraction; Transforms; Dynamic scheduling; Filters; Wireless networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2024 Boao New Power System International Forum - Power System and New Energy Technology Innovation Forum, NPSIF 2024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By forecasting the potential presence of a connection between two nodes in a network, link prediction has extensive applications in areas such as power grid management, forecasting, and security. Recently, Graph Neural Network (GNN) based link prediction methods have effectively leveraged deep learning techniques for link prediction tasks and have garnered significant attention. However, many GNN-based approaches focus on feature extraction from the adjacency matrix for embedding at a single scale based on the entire graph structure. In many scenarios, the presence of a link between two nodes is influenced not only by the nodes themselves but also by potential conflicting links among their neighboring nodes at various scales. Thus, incorporating the effects of links and nodes across different scales within the graph is crucial for accurate link prediction for a given node pair. Furthermore, while heuristic information is frequently used as embedding features in link prediction, its integration into GNN-based methods has been relatively limited. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Bi-order Graph Attention Auto-Encoder with Neighbor Node Correlation Embedding (BGAEN) for link prediction. BGAEN enhances graph node features by integrating heuristic information. Additionally, BGAEN incorporates a node correlation-based graph auto-encoding loss to embed heuristic correlation features into node representations. These extracted correlation of node representations are then utilized into a bi-order graph attention neural network as the encoder to capture features across multiple neighborhood scales to alleviate the conflict risk for link prediction. Experimental results show that the BGAEN approach outperforms traditional link prediction methods. The experiments also confirm the effectiveness of the multi-scale neighborhood information and node correlation embedding designed in BGAEN. © 2024 IEEE.","2024","2025-04-04 09:37:20","2025-11-25 20:39:06","","436-444","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/TKGEDTA8/Mai et al. - 2024 - Bi-Order Graph Attention Neural Network with Neighbor Node Correlation Embedding for Link Prediction.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/58KD2H8I/Mai et al. - 2024 - Bi-Order Graph Attention Neural Network with Neighbor Node Correlation Embedding for Link Prediction.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/KI2K4TXY/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/3K3GJV4Y/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/FQ4V6PME/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/YJYBPBL4/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/TTKXHRDW/page-5.html","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10866387&ref=","#done; Graph neural networks; Auto encoders; Neural-networks; Prediction models; Embeddings; Graph embeddings; Network embeddings; Node correlations; graph attention neural network; graph auto-encoder; link prediction; Signal encoding; Graph auto-encoder; Order graph; Graph attention neural network; Link prediction; Neighbour nodes; #grid-analysis","Power grids; Network topology; Correlation; Forecasting; Representation learning; Feature extraction; Prediction methods; Security; Periodic structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2024 4th International Conference on Electronic Information Engineering and Computer Technology, EIECT 2024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, with the widespread access to distributed renewable power generation resources, the structure and operation mode of the power grid, especially the distribution network, are becoming more and more complex. The traditional VV C method is difficult to cope with this new situation due to its inherent limitations. challenge. These limitations include, but are not limited to, the static nature of the control strategy, lack of adaptability to dynamic changes in the grid, and computational inefficiency when dealing with large-scale networks. With the widespread use of artificial intelligence in smart grids, some deep-reinforcement learning algorithms have been used to solve this problem. However, because the algorithm is not good enough for controlling complex environments, in order to overcome these challenges, this paper proposes innovative methods based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and graph neural networks (GNN). GNN is used to extract graphical representations from topological maps of power systems and is trained with data from the VVC environment.

However, this integration introduces security vulnerabilities and their exploitation leads to cyber-attacks causing severe consequences like infrastructural damage, massive blackouts. This paper presents an effective approach to detect anomaly and cyber threat in smart grids based on deep learning. A novel Graph Neural Network and Transformer encoder (GNN-Transformer encoder) feature extraction method is proposed in this paper for anomaly and cyber threat identification. Initially, the input data is normalized using min-max normalization technique to transform the data into a common scale. The GNN is utilized for spatial feature extraction which conducts representation learning based on topology of power system. The transformer encoder with self-attention mechanism determines the importance of different time steps and captures long-range dependencies. The fully connected layers provided accurate prediction results by mapping the high-dimensional feature vectors to the final output. The proposed method is evaluated on PMU dataset and achieved high accuracy 97.90%, precision 0.82, recall 0.98.

The present work proposes a typed graph neural network based approach to solve the power flow problem. The neural networks are trained on benchmark power grid cases which are modified by varying the injections (load and generation), branch characteristics and topology. The solution to the power flow analysis is found when all voltage values are known. The proposed system infers the voltage magnitude and phase and is trained so that the obtained values minimize the violation of the physical laws that govern the system, this way the training is achieved in an unsupervised manner. The proposed solver has linear time complexity and is able to generalize to grids with considerably different conditions, including size, from the grids available during training. Though the training is unsupervised and does not suppose any ground truth data, the solutions obtained are found to have a close correlation with the conventional Newton–Raphson method. The results are additionally validated by finding the root mean square deviation from the Newton–Raphson method, and the faster, though less accurate, DC approximation method.","2023-01-01","2024-06-26 09:43:27","2025-11-25 21:05:27","2024-04-25 13:29:09","105567","","","117","","Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","21 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 18 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 13 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/2UUT7E6M/Lopez-Garcia and Domínguez-Navarro - 2023 - Power flow analysis via typed graph neural network.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/B6NXY8G3/Lopez-Garcia and Domínguez-Navarro - 2023 - Power flow analysis via typed graph neural network.ocr.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/J4B889VB/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/LVBT4XPI/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/EESKEFLC/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/JM2DQG9G/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/A3NNY87N/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/YV2JEMAS/S0952197622005577.html; ","https://zaguan.unizar.es/record/124057/files/texto_completo.pdf; notion://www.notion.so/Lopez-Garcia-Dom-nguez-Navarro-2023-315db771f1b349e791cee85024354b1b; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197622005577","#done; Power grids; Graph neural networks; Unsupervised learning; Neural-networks; Power flow; Power flow problem; Power flows; Electric load flow; Power flow analyze; notion; Electric power transmission networks; Complex networks; Numerical methods; Flow graphs; Network-based approach; Physics-informed neural networks; Physic-informed neural network; Electricity system; Newton-Raphson's method; #grid-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, due to the nonconvexities that arise in power generation systems, there is not yet a fast, robust solution technique for the full Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF). In the last decades, power grids have evolved into a typical dynamic, non-linear and large-scale control system, known as the power system, so searching for better and faster ACOPF solutions is becoming crucial. Appearance of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) has allowed the natural use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms on graph data, such as power networks. On the other hand, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is known for its powerful capability to solve complex decision-making problems. Although solutions that use these two methods separately are beginning to appear in the literature, none has yet combined the advantages of both. We propose a novel architecture based on the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm with Graph Neural Networks to solve the Optimal Power Flow. The objective is to design an architecture that learns how to solve the optimization problem and that is at the same time able to generalize to unseen scenarios.

With the wide adoption of advanced smart meters, more attention has been paid to short-term residential load forecasting. Most of the existing load forecasting methods are mainly focused on using temporal information of historical loads, and information of neighboring houses are generally ignored. However, houses in the same or neighboring areas may show similar consumption patterns due to shared conditions such as temperature, holiday impacts. Such information can be very helpful for machine learning based forecasting methods. In this paper, we propose to tackle the short-term residential load forecasting including both the individual load and aggregated load with a graph neural network based forecasting framework. The proposed framework can capture the hidden spatial dependencies of different houses without even any prior knowledge requirement on the geographic information for these houses.

Their accuracy is limited, since they are hard to learn from other algorithms to improve their own performance. To improve the accuracy of transformer fault diagnosis, a novel method for transformer fault diagnosis based on graph convolutional network (GCN) is proposed. The proposed method has the advantages of two kinds of existing methods. Specifically, the adjacency matrix of GCN is utilized to fully represent the similarity metrics between unknown samples and labeled samples. Furthermore, the graph convolutional layers with strong feature extraction ability are used as a classifier to find the complex nonlinear relationship between dissolved gas and fault type. The back propagation algorithm is used to complete the training process of GCN. The simulation results show that the performance of GCN is better than that of the existing methods such as convolutional neural network, multi-layer perceptron, support vector machine, extreme gradient boosting tree, k-nearest neighbors and Siamese network in different input features and data volumes, which can effectively meet the needs of diagnostic accuracy.","2021","2024-06-26 09:43:27","2025-06-15 18:55:55","2024-05-16 11:17:02","241-249","","2","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Aalborg University's Research Portal","","92 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 41 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 41 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/I579DBP5/Liao et al. - 2021 - Fault Diagnosis of Power Transformers Using Graph .ocr.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/FJZHKG5Q/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/WZWUKRYB/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/X6EGLBFI/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/SAS9JSUW/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/KIWB8LGJ/page-5.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/4IBYZNHD/Liao et al. - 2021 - Fault Diagnosis of Power Transformers Using Graph .pdf","notion://www.notion.so/Liao-et-al-2021-0b9bcb41903c44eca9fe8a4619525dc1; https://vbn.aau.dk/files/475862057/Fault_diagnosis_of_power_transformers_using_graph_convolutional_network.pdf","#done; #faults-reliability","fault diagnosis; graph convolutional network; Power transformer; similarity metrics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compared to deep learning models, existing statistical-based prediction models are not well suited to learn how to represent power load data and mine the rich information in the data. In addition, power load data needs to consider both intra-series temporal correlation and inter-series correlation. Recently, attempts have been made to capture both correlations simultaneously, but most of the studies capture only temporal correlations in the time domain and use predefined a priori as inter-sequence relationships. In this paper, SFLGNN (Spectral-Frequency Learning Based Graph Neural Network) is designed for power load forecasting. SFLGNN effectively solves the problem by capturing both variable correlation and inter-sequence correlation using graph neural networks, and extracts important features through CP decomposition with multi-attention mechanism. In addition, SFLGNN enhances representation learning through Spectral-Frequency Learning. We performed comparative experiments, ablation experiments, and hyper-parameter sensitivity experiments on our collected dataset. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model in the power load forecasting task. © 2024 IEEE.","2024","2025-04-04 09:39:17","2025-11-26 09:35:31","","23-27","","","","","","SFLGNN","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-11-26] 0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07]","","; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/7N4PFNA4/Li et al. - 2024 - SFLGNN Power Load Forecasting Based on Spectral-Frequency Learning and Graph Neural Network.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/8X3Z7QRG/10795826.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/7SK87YJ7/Li et al. - 2024 - SFLGNN Power Load Forecasting Based on Spectral-Frequency Learning and Graph Neural Network.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/WRCSWHXL/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/J8KTI2VZ/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/BFG4BEE3/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/SXDBRJ7K/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/34XVZNV4/page-5.html","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10795826&ref=; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10795826","#done; Graph neural networks; graph neural network; Representation learning; Power load forecasting; Power load; Learning neural networks; Load data; Network power; power load forecasting; representation learning; Spectral frequency; Temporal correlations; tensor factorization; Tensor factorization; #forecasting","Time series analysis; Computational modeling; Correlation; Predictive models; Load forecasting; Data models; Feature extraction; Load modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2024 4th International Conference on Computer Systems, ICCS 2024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the limited length of short electrical record texts causes severe information sparsity, and numerous domain-specific terminologies of power systems makes it difficult to transfer knowledge from language models pre-trained on general-domain texts. Traditional event detection approaches primarily focus on the general domain and ignore these two problems in the power system domain. To address the above issues, we propose a Multi-Channel graph neural network utilizing Type information for Event Detection in power systems, named MC-TED, leveraging a semantic channel and a topological channel to enrich information interaction from short texts. Concretely, the semantic channel refines textual representations with semantic similarity, building the semantic information interaction among potential event-related words. The topological channel generates a relation-type-aware graph modeling word dependencies, and a word-type-aware graph integrating part-of-speech tags. To further reduce errors worsened by professional terminologies in type analysis, a type learning mechanism is designed for updating the representations of both the word type and relation type in the topological channel. In this way, the information sparsity and professional term occurrence problems can be alleviated by enabling interaction between topological and semantic information. Furthermore, to address the lack of labeled data in power systems, we built a Chinese event detection dataset based on electrical Power Event texts, named PoE. In experiments, our model achieves compelling results not only on the PoE dataset, but on general-domain event detection datasets including ACE 2005 and MAVEN.","2022-11-15","2024-06-26 09:43:27","2025-06-15 18:55:54","2024-04-18 11:56:42","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","8 citations (Semantic Scholar/arXiv) [2025-04-09] arXiv:2211.08168 [cs]","","; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/XY6RKA5U/2211.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/XWDZ9XHW/Li et al. - 2022 - Type Information Utilized Event Detection via Mult.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/8UFY2UWZ/Li et al. - 2022 - Type Information Utilized Event Detection via Mult.ocr.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/PK96BHTS/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/EE8J3DJE/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/MA9HLKTC/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/A7DBSUSW/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/EXJDIGGV/page-5.html","https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08168; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.08168.pdf; notion://www.notion.so/Li-et-al-2022-e45af6a4e4fe40c695139c99d8da0aab","#done; notion; #faults-reliability","Computer Science - Computation and Language","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2211.08168","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The new architecture PDHG-Net is designed by unrolling the recently emerged PDHG method into a neural network, combined with channel-expansion techniques borrowed from graph neural networks. We prove that the proposed PDHG-Net can recover PDHG algorithm, thus can approximate optimal solutions of LP instances with a polynomial number of neurons. We propose a two-stage inference approach: first use PDHG-Net to generate an approximate solution, and then apply PDHG algorithm to further improve the solution. Experiments show that our approach can significantly accelerate LP solving, achieving up to a 3$\times$ speedup compared to FOMs for large-scale LP problems.","2024-06-06","2025-04-04 10:32:16","2025-11-25 14:02:49","2025-04-04 10:32:16","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","4 citations (Semantic Scholar/arXiv) [2025-04-09] 4 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] arXiv:2406.01908 [cs] version: 2","","; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/QWRD7NLS/Li et al. - 2024 - PDHG-Unrolled Learning-to-Optimize Method for Large-Scale Linear Programming.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/IBYEUMX8/Li et al. - 2024 - PDHG-Unrolled Learning-to-Optimize Method for Large-Scale Linear Programming.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/JNJDBN83/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/BEQUZRJ5/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/RI45RK96/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/2PQQA8LS/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/SU64NA9Y/page-5.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/IGKUJRFU/2406.html","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.01908v2; https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01908","#done; #optimization-control","Computer Science - Machine Learning; Mathematics - Optimization and Control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2406.01908","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing works have mostly adopted the conventional routine of representing the power systems (a graph with tree topology) as vectors to train deep reinforcement learning (RL) policies. We propose a framework that combines RL with graph neural networks and study the benefits and limitations of graph-based policy in the VVC setting. Our results show that graph-based policies converge to the same rewards asymptotically, however at a slower rate when compared to vector representation counterpart. We conduct further analysis on the impact of both observations and actions: On the observation end, we examine the robustness of graph-based policies on two typical data acquisition errors in power systems, namely sensor communication failure and measurement misalignment. Furthermore, we study the robustness of graph-based policies to erroneous topological information in the graph representation. Our results reveal that graph-based policies are significantly more robust than policies with conventional dense network representations. On the action end, we show that actuators have various impacts on the system, thus using a graph representation induced by the physical power systems topology may not be the optimal choice. In the end, we conduct a case study to demonstrate that the choice of readout function architecture and graph augmentation can further improve training performance and robustness.","2022-10-01","2024-06-26 09:43:27","2025-11-25 13:19:55","2024-05-08 14:16:22","119530","","","323","","Applied Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","28 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 15 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 15 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 15 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/8PXI7QS7/Lee et al. - 2022 - A graph policy network approach for Volt-Var Contr.ocr.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/SVADU2EW/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/QIUPPSK2/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/6SRYLPYM/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/DNZ4GPXM/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/2IG7XH59/page-5.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/FHFP6ZIL/S0306261922008479.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/L55IG6YF/Lee et al. - 2022 - A graph policy network approach for Volt-Var Contr.pdf","notion://www.notion.so/Lee-et-al-2022-567c95f5d0f846e9ab79d2c0783f74c8; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261922008479; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.12073","#done; notion; #optimization-control","Graph neural networks; Deep reinforcement learning; Volt-Var Control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These include numerical instabilities, convergence time depending on the starting point of the iterative method, and the quadratic computational complexity of a single iteration regarding the number of state variables. This paper introduces an original graph neural network based SE implementation over the augmented factor graph of the nonlinear power system SE, capable of incorporating measurements on both branches and buses, as well as both phasor and legacy measurements. The proposed regression model has linear computational complexity during the inference time once trained, with a possibility of distributed implementation.

The accuracy of these systems can be compromised by issues such as noisy or low-quality sensor data, which may lead to false positives or missed faults. Additionally, the complexity of managing large volumes of data from numerous IoT devices can strain the system, further affecting detection accuracy. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes an efficient approach for fault uncovering in solar power system grounded on IoT. The data are collected from solar power generation dataset. Subsequently, the data are nourished to preprocessing. In preprocessing segment removes the absent values in the data utilizing Reverse Lognormal Kalman Filter (RLKF). The consequence after the preprocessing data is transported to the Multiresolution Sinusoidal Neural Network (MSNN). The line-line faults, ground faults, line-ground faults and partial shading are successfully predicted and classified by using MSNN. The Snow Geese Optimization (SGO) is rummage-sale to optimize the weight structure of MSNN. The projected MSNN-SGO is utilized within the MATLAB platform.

Therefore, accurate and efficient calculation of the status of distribution networks is of great significance for the safe, stable, and economic operation of power systems. Traditional distribution network status calculation methods are usually based on physical models of the power system, require a large amount of mathematical calculation and simulation analysis, and are difficult to meet the real-time requirements of modern power systems. To address this issue, this paper proposes a distribution network status calculation method based on heterogeneous graph mask modeling. This method utilizes a heterogeneous graph neural network to model the distribution network, represents the nodes and edges of the distribution network as nodes and edges in the graph, and utilizes graph mask technology to reconstruct node attributes and edges in self-supervised manner. Through a pre-trained graph neural network model, the status of the distribution network can be quickly and accurately calculated. Experimental results show that this method can accurately model the topological relationship and state variables of the distribution network, demonstrating high accuracy on downstream tasks.

Towards fast credible contingency analysis, a power flow calculation method based on graph neural network was proposed. This method can realize fast fitting of nonlinear relationship between new energy output, load data and branch power flow, node voltage in multiple scenarios. To avoid the disappearance of edge graph nodes caused by branch disconnection and to ensure the robustness of the model, a matrix reflecting the topology changes is designed in response to the network structure changes caused by various anticipated accidents. Besides, the load-source data is separated and the input eigenvector considering the change of the load-source data is constructed.

More often than not, market integration can increase social welfare for the whole power system with a clear spatial dependence structure among area electricity prices, which motivates a new perspective on electricity price forecasting. In this paper, we construct a model to forecast the day-ahead electricity prices of Nord Pool with spatial dependence. First of all, we convert the electricity prices into graph data. Then, we propose an STGNN (Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network) model to exploit spatial and temporal features. In particular, the STGNN model can accurately forecast electricity prices for multiple areas, where the adjacency matrix representing the spatial dependence structure is pre-captured by the R-vine (regular vine) copula. Our results show that the spatial dependence structure described by the R-vine copula can perfectly reflect the physical characteristics of the electricity system; moreover, the forecasting performance of the proposed STGNN model is significantly better than the existing models in terms of overall accuracy and hourly accuracy within a day. © 2023 International Institute of Forecasters","2023","2024-07-31 11:06:16","2025-06-16 18:39:24","","","","","","","Int.

However, such methods are challenged by the computer networking model characterized by a natural continuous-time dynamic heterogeneous graph. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous graph neural network based APT detection method in smart grid clouds. Our model is an encoder-decoder structure. The encoder uses heterogeneous temporal memory and attention embedding modules to capture contextual information of interactions of network entities from the time and spatial dimensions respectively.

In this context, fast and robust state estimation (SE) is timely and of major importance to maintaining a comprehensive view of the system in real-time. Conventional PSSE solvers typically entail minimizing a nonlinear and nonconvex least-squares cost using e.g., the Gauss-Newton method. Those iterative solvers however, are sensitive to initialization and may converge to local minima. To overcome these hurdles, the present paper draws recent advances on image denoising to put forth a novel PSSE formulation with a data-driven regularization term capturing a deep neural network (DNN) prior. For the resultant regularized PSSE objective, a 'Gauss-Newton-type' alternating minimization solver is developed first. To accommodate real-time monitoring, a novel end-to-end DNN is constructed subsequently by unrolling the proposed alternating minimization solver. The deep PSSE architecture can further account for the power network topology through a graph neural network (GNN) based prior. To further endow the physics-based DNN with robustness against bad data, an adversarial DNN training method is put forth. Numerical tests using real load data on the IEEE 118-bus benchmark system showcase the improved estimation and robustness performance of the proposed scheme compared with several state-of-the-art alternatives. © 2022 IEEE.","2022","2024-07-31 11:06:16","2025-06-16 12:48:19","","172-181","","1","12","","IEEE J.

A wind turbine consists of several subsystems, each containing various sensors that collect multivariate time series. These subsystems can naturally classify the turbines into clusters. This clustering strongly correlates variables within the same cluster, and the correlation between two clusters can be derived from engineering knowledge. In this study, we propose a hierarchical multivariate time series forecasting method based on a spatial-temporal graph convolution network (HMTGCN) to forecast wind power by leveraging engineering knowledge. The model uses a spatial-temporal graph neural network (GNN) containing a graph learning module to extract features from each time-series cluster. These features are concatenated to form graph data at the cluster level, which are subsequently processed by a graph convolution network. We evaluated the performance using simulation experiments and a real-life wind power dataset, and the results showed that the proposed method improved the prediction performance by 8.99% on average, which demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of our approach. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","2024","2024-06-26 09:43:56","2025-11-25 21:50:30","","1-13","","","73","","IEEE Trans.

The trained model is then used to predict the data, and the anomaly score between the predicted and actual values is calculated. Finally, the wavelet variance is used to analyze the data period.

To maintain the security of power systems, it is critical to develop efficient locational detectors for FDIAs. However, designing FDIA detectors that could model the inherent underlying graph structures of smart grids and spatially correlated measurement data residing on both branches and buses such that FDIAs in the edge space could be detected and located, remains an open problem. In this work, we propose an alternative graph representation for smart grids, regarding both the power flows on branches and power injections on buses, such that we could simultaneously process these data in the edge space. We propose a Hodge Aggregation Graph Neural Network (AGNN)-based FDIA detector, leveraging the Hodge theory and exploiting the Hodge Laplacian into the AGNN. We further develop a Hodge Aggregation Graph Attention Network (AGAT)-based FDIA detector to enhance the locational detection performance of the Hodge AGNN-based detector, by utilizing the graph attention mechanism. Illustrative simulation results demonstrate the superior locational detection performance of the proposed detectors, compared to the other state-of-the-art FDIA detectors.

The traditional algorithm only uses the measurement data of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system and wide area measurement system (WAMS) at the same time section for state estimation, fails to make effective use of WAMS measurement data, and the time resolution is low. Therefore, based on graph neural network model, this paper proposes a fast state estimation method of nodes in the whole network. This paper simulates on 57 nodes in New England and generates three different data sets.

Accurately and efficiently achieving power system state estimation is becoming challenging. Data-driven methods shows strong application potential in state estimate for the high time efficiency. While ignoring the physical topology of power systems limits previous data-driven methods mining of complete information. In this paper, we propose an integrated model-driven and data-driven model to monitor the dynamic change of system states accurately and rapidly. First, a model-driven method is used to extract the features with high entropy and reduce the computational complexity, which retains the strong coupling relationship between electrical parameters. Then, a graph neural network-based method is introduced to take full advantage of topology information. The edge and node features are selected as the input of data-driven method to fully adapt the internal laws of data and further improve accuracy. The simulation results show the superiority of the integrated method in terms of reliability, efficiency and accuracy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","2022","2024-07-31 11:06:16","2025-11-17 19:09:43","","","","","139","","Int J Electr Power Energy Syst","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","12 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 9 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 9 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/L6QKE8X2/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/KVCE59JJ/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/RS73KC9E/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/HKWCTZTI/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/KLQEW66I/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/U9K294VV/Wu et al. - 2022 - Integrating model-driven and data-driven methods f.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/PSWQ8G3F/Wu et al. - 2022 - Integrating model-driven and data-driven methods f.pdf","","#done; Graph neural networks; Power; Data-driven methods; Topology; Data driven; Renewable energy resources; State estimation; Data-driven; #Check; Dynamic edge condition; Edge conditions; Fast state; Fast state estimation; Graph convolution network; Model-driven; Modeling data; #grid-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, many researchers have participated in the research of branch parameter identification. The existing methods of power grid branch parameter identification suffer from two limitations. (1) Traditional methods only use manual experience or instruments to complete parameter identification of single branch characteristics, but they are only used to identify a single target and cannot make full use of the historical information of power grid data. (2) Deep learning methods can complete model training through historical data, but these methods cannot consider the constraints of power grid topological structure, which is equivalent to identifying connected power grid branches separately. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel multitask Graph Transformer Network (GTN), which combines a graph neural network and a multiattention mechanism to construct our model. Specifically, we input the global features and topology information of branch nodes into our GTN model. In the process of parameter identification, the multihead attention mechanism is used to fuse the branch feature information of different subspaces, which highlights the importance of different branches and enhances the ability of local feature extraction. Finally, the fitting and prediction of each branch feature are completed through the decoding layer. The experiment shows that our proposed GTN is superior to other machine learning methods and deep learning methods and can still realize accurate branch parameter identification under various noise conditions. © 2021 Zhiwei Wang et al.","2021","2024-07-31 11:06:16","2025-11-25 13:48:23","","","","","2021","","Complexity","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","9 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 6 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] Publisher: Hindawi Limited","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/GA9RI8AK/Wang et al. - 2021 - Application of Multiattention Mechanism in Power S.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/E83LTPSQ/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/GSZJJDIK/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/VHB8TUV3/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/N3HCCWV7/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/UH5ZGWKR/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/XDVIGKCS/Wang et al. - 2021 - Application of Multiattention Mechanism in Power S.ocr.pdf","https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2021/1834428.pdf","#done; Graph neural networks; Deep learning; Attention mechanisms; Topology; Learning systems; Electric power transmission networks; Machine learning methods; Topology information; #Check; Parameter estimation; Feature information; Historical information; Local feature extraction; Unsolved problems; #grid-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, growing complexity and unpredictability make this an increasingly complex and computationally difficult task. In recent times, machine learning methods have gained attention for their ability to handle complex modeling applications. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in particular, are widely used in literature for their adaptability for classification problems. While CNNs generate promising results and some real-time advantages, they still require long training times and computational resources. This paper proposes a graph neural network (GNN) approach to the small-signal security assessment problem using data from Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). Using a GNN, the process for small signal security assessment can be optimized, reducing the time needed from minutes, to less than a second, thus allowing for faster real-time application. Also, using graph properties, optimal PMU placement is determined and the proposed method is shown to perform efficiently under partial observability with limited PMU data. Case studies with simulated data from the IEEE 68-bus system and the NPCC 140-bus system are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method showing comparisons with the CNN. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","2024","2024-07-31 11:15:58","2025-11-25 21:41:40","","","","","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","1 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 0 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/YN3DRC9M/Justin and Paternain - 2024 - Real-Time Small-Signal Security Assessment Using G.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/YJ5LKFEN/Justin and Paternain - 2024 - Real-Time Small-Signal Security Assessment Using G.ocr.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/C5V5VIPW/Justin and Paternain - 2024 - Real-Time Small-Signal Security Assessment Using G.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/FQXTYDQ5/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/N9EBRSYD/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/777ZPM2Z/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/INBXR8RC/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/CJGTUAN5/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/UDPA35QI/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/4BBBWNM6/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/BDJA3UC5/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/HMJLTZC3/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/LGK3FCWY/page-5.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/GSS37C7F/display.html","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02964; https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197819279&origin=SingleRecordEmailAlert&dgcid=raven_sc_search_en_us_email&txGid=cd51e39d6fe60794d9900e35d9e40e7c","#done; Graph neural networks; Power systems; Power; Convolutional neural network; Phasor measurement units; Network security; Power system; Learning systems; Complex networks; Electric power system stability; Real- time; Real time systems; Security; Bus systems; Security assessment; Small signal stability; Small-signal security assessments; Small-signal stability; #faults-reliability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One such approach involves placing transformer neutral blocking devices, which interrupt the path of geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) to limit their impact. The high cost of these devices and the sparsity of transformers that experience high GICs during GMD events, however, calls for a sparse placement strategy that involves high computational cost. To address this challenge, we developed a physics-informed heterogeneous graph neural network (PIHGNN) for solving the graph-based dc-blocker placement problem. Our approach combines a heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) with a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to capture the diverse types of nodes and edges in ac/dc networks and incorporates the physical laws of the power grid. We train the PIHGNN model using a surrogate power flow model and validate it using case studies. Results demonstrate that PIHGNN can effectively and efficiently support the deployment of GIC dc-current blockers, ensuring the continued supply of electricity to meet societal demands. Our approach has the potential to contribute to the development of more reliable and resilient power grids capable of withstanding the growing threat that GMDs pose.","2024-05-16","2024-07-17 23:52:04","2025-11-25 21:52:13","2024-07-17 23:52:04","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","1 citations (Semantic Scholar/arXiv) [2025-04-09] 1 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] arXiv:2405.10389 [cs, eess]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/HRM266IX/Jin et al. - 2024 - Physics-Informed Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networ.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/8TJ5DBSK/2405.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/SZQW3ULI/Jin et al. - 2024 - Physics-Informed Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networ.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/A9DY8HPZ/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/TWF4K2DH/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/GP9ZMGPR/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/C6WMDVAR/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/4MFZQDP9/page-5.html","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.10389.pdf; https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10389","#done; #optimization-control","Computer Science - Machine Learning; Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Systems and Control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2405.10389","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After a local disturbance, successive resultant can be distant from the source. Since avalanche failures can propagate unexpectedly, care must be taken when formulating a mitigation strategy. Herein, we propose a strategy for mitigating such cascading failures. First, to characterize the impact of each node on the avalanche dynamics, we propose a novel measure, that of Avalanche Centrality (AC). Then, based on the ACs, nodes potentially needing reinforcement are identified and selected for mitigation. Compared with heuristic measures, AC has proven to be efficient at reducing avalanche size; however, due to nonlocal propagation, calculating ACs can be computationally burdensome. To resolve this problem, we use a graph neural network (GNN). We begin by training a GNN using a large number of small networks; then, once trained, the GNN can predict ACs efficiently in large networks and real-world topological power grids in manageable computational time. Thus, under our strategy, mitigation in large networks is achieved by reinforcing nodes with large ACs. The framework developed in this study can be implemented in other complex processes that require longer computational time to simulate large networks.","2023-01-09","2024-06-26 09:43:27","2025-11-17 19:11:31","2024-05-16 08:16:09","013115","","1","33","","Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","8 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 7 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 7 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/XAYJJ4EE/Jhun et al. - 2023 - Prediction and mitigation of nonlocal cascading fa.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/6IZTAJLZ/Jhun et al. - 2023 - Prediction and mitigation of nonlocal cascading fa.ocr.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/ADAFKDQK/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/UF5PG2FA/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/ELGZGRC9/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/55DE2DY4/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/58XIHDDJ/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/XNISMIY4/2877578.html; ","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/cha/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/5.0107420/16758862/013115_1_online.pdf; notion://www.notion.so/Jhun-et-al-2023-f09498ea9a9c43978f68060b0f49544e; https://pubs.aip.org/aip/cha/article/33/1/013115/2877578","#done; prediction; notion; artificial neural network; article; mitigation; reinforcement (psychology); #faults-reliability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To effectively evaluate the stability of power systems, this study proposes an intelligent power system evaluation method based on spectral graph neural networks. By analyzing the correlation of multivariate chaotic time series in the potential correlation layer, the prediction and evaluation of system transient stability is achieved. In the prediction of the generator rotor relative speed, the stator side transient potential time series, and the excitation limiter output time series, the prediction and evaluation accuracy of the research model are 98.25%, 97.26%, and 97.28%, respectively, which are better than similar models.

Graph Neural Networks have demonstrated significant potential in state estimation for power systems by effectively analyzing measurement data and capturing the complex interactions and interrelations among the measurements through the system's graph structure. However, the information about the system's graph structure may be inaccurate due to noise, attack or lack of accurate information about the topology of the system. This paper studies these scenarios under topology uncertainties and evaluates the impact of the topology uncertainties on the performance of a Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (TGCN) for state estimation in power systems. In order to make the model resilient to topology uncertainties, modifications in the TGCN model are proposed to incorporate a knowledge graph, generated based on the measurement data. This knowledge graph supports the assumed uncertain system graph. Two variations of the TGCN architecture are introduced to integrate the knowledge graph, and their performances are evaluated and compared to demonstrate improved resilience against topology uncertainties. The evaluation results indicate that while the two proposed architecture show different performance, they both improve the performance of the TGCN state estimation under topology uncertainties.","2024-10-21","2025-04-04 10:17:44","2025-11-26 09:35:05","2025-04-04 10:17:44","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-11-26] 0 citations (Semantic Scholar/arXiv) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] arXiv:2410.16008 [eess] version: 1","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/G8HZUFUS/Haghshenas and Naeini - 2024 - Resilient Temporal GCN for Smart Grid State Estimation Under Topology Inaccuracies.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/IIK2RILM/Haghshenas and Naeini - 2024 - Resilient Temporal GCN for Smart Grid State Estimation Under Topology Inaccuracies.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/DTMXC48T/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/3MUTE875/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/C8K6PNEW/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/9ISZWD2N/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/UZ993RBG/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/AUNFF2TN/2410.html; ","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.16008v1; https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16008","#done; #grid-analysis","Computer Science - Machine Learning; Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Signal Processing; Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2410.16008","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While data-driven alternatives based on Machine Learning models could be a choice, they suffer in DSSE because of the lack of labeled data. In fact, measurements in the distribution system are often noisy, corrupted, and unavailable. To address these issues, we propose the Deep Statistical Solver for Distribution System State Estimation (DSS<sup>2</sup>), a deep learning model based on graph neural networks (GNNs) that accounts for the network structure of the distribution system and the governing power flow equations of the problem. DSS<sup>2</sup> is based on GNN and leverages hypergraphs to model the network as a graph into the deep-learning algorithm and to represent the heterogeneous components of the distribution systems. A weakly supervised learning approach is put forth to train the DSS<sup>2</sup>: by enforcing the GNN output into the power flow equations, we force the DSS<sup>2</sup> to respect the physics of the distribution system. This strategy enables learning from noisy measurements and alleviates the need for ideal labeled data. Extensive experiments with case studies on the IEEE 14-bus, 70-bus, and 179-bus networks showed the DSS<sup>2</sup> outperforms the conventional Weighted Least Squares algorithm in accuracy, convergence, and computational time while being more robust to noisy, erroneous, and missing measurements.

To address this, deep learning techniques, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have emerged. However, existing literature primarily focuses on balanced networks, leaving a critical gap in supporting unbalanced three-phase power grids. This letter introduces PowerFlowMultiNet, a novel multigraph GNN framework explicitly designed for unbalanced three-phase power grids. The proposed approach models each phase separately in a multigraph representation, effectively capturing the inherent asymmetry in unbalanced grids. A graph embedding mechanism utilizing message passing is introduced to capture spatial dependencies within the power system network.

Traditional methods for grid analysis struggle with the computational demands of large-scale RES and ES integration, prompting the adoption of machine learning (ML) techniques, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs have proven effective in solving the alternating current (AC) Power Flow (PF) and Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems, crucial for operational planning. However, existing benchmarks and datasets completely ignore safety and robustness requirements in their evaluation and never consider realistic safety-critical scenarios that most impact the operations of the power grids. We present SafePowerGraph, the first simulator-agnostic, safety-oriented framework and benchmark for GNNs in PS operations.

Increasing shares of distributed energy resources (e.g. renewable energy generators, electric vehicles) and internet-connected sensing and control devices (e.g. smart heating and cooling) require new tools to support accurate, datadriven decision making. Modelling the effect of such growing complexity in the electrical grid is possible in principle using state-of-the-art power-power flow models. In practice, the detailed information needed for these physical simulations may be unknown or prohibitively expensive to obtain. Hence, datadriven approaches to power systems modelling, including feedforward neural networks and auto-encoders, have been studied to leverage the increasing availability of sensor data, but have seen limited practical adoption due to lack of transparency and inefficiencies on large-scale problems. Our work addresses this gap by proposing a data- and knowledge-driven probabilistic graphical model for energy systems based on the framework of graph neural networks (GNNs). The model can explicitly factor in domain knowledge, in the form of grid topology or physics constraints, thus resulting in sparser architectures and much smaller parameters dimensionality when compared with traditional machine-learning models with similar accuracy. Results obtained from a real-world smart-grid demonstration project show how the GNN was used to inform grid congestion predictions and market bidding services for a distribution system operator participating in an energy flexibility market.","2021-03-12","2024-06-26 09:43:09","2025-06-15 20:03:08","2024-04-18 10:54:46","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","14 citations (Semantic Scholar/arXiv) [2025-04-09] arXiv:2103.07248 [cs]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/7JID7HAA/Fusco et al. - 2021 - Knowledge- and Data-driven Services for Energy Sys.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/MDPLMAYR/2103.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/FJ59U73R/Fusco et al. - 2021 - Knowledge- and Data-driven Services for Energy Sys.ocr.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/QM6FDS2Y/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/7IWHGCAX/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/APC5THLA/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/CL7C3LE6/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/ELK24THK/page-5.html","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07248.pdf; https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07248; notion://www.notion.so/Fusco-et-al-2021-28cd1ced32d04429a4a49cbfdb09e25e","#done; notion; #data-management","Computer Science - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2103.07248","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fast and accurate distribution network fault location is one of the important means to ensure the safe and stable operation of the power system and is helpful in guiding troubleshooting, shortening the power outage time, reducing the workload of manual inspection, and reducing the social and economic losses caused by faults. Due to the development of the new distribution network, the comprehensive influence of many factors has put forward new challenges to the traditional distribution network fault location methods. In this paper, a distribution network fault location method based on the graph neural network is proposed. Firstly, the distribution network is treated as non-Euclidean graph data; secondly, variational graph auto-encoders (VGAE) are used to mine the underlying information of nodes and improve the overall anti-noise performance of the fault location method. Then the GraphSAGE model is used to aggregate the neighbor information of nodes, fully consider the influence of the surrounding lines on the target lines, and improve the output of the model to locate the distribution network line where the fault occurred. The experimental example analysis based on OpenDSS simulation software (version 9.8) proves that the proposed method has high accuracy and anti-interference, and the accuracy reached 97.81%. Moreover, the positioning result is still good in the new intelligent distribution network scenario with distributed power access, with an accuracy of 95.07% in the hybrid power generation scenario. © 2024 by the authors.","2024","2024-11-14 14:27:11","2025-06-15 18:55:40","","","","10","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 0 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/C5INZA6P/Fan et al. - 2024 - Fault Location Method of Distribution Network Based on VGAE-GraphSAGE.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/EEMSSFF3/Fan et al. - 2024 - Fault Location Method of Distribution Network Based on VGAE-GraphSAGE.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/TPAGSJMQ/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/4NBYFAKV/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/F6Y7QFKP/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/U2ITCGLT/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/BUI42SCL/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/63IRF4MC/display.html; ","https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/12/10/2179/pdf?version=1728381257; https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207371780&origin=SingleRecordEmailAlert&dgcid=raven_sc_search_en_us_email&txGid=5ddac24c043fc39e4029199e0dc78963","#done; Graph neural networks; Location method; Network-based; Power distribution faults; Power distribution networks; Auto encoders; distribution network; fault location; feature extraction; Features extraction; graph neural network; Network faults; Power; Power transmission and distributions; Safe operation; Stable operation; #faults-reliability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Amidst the rising trend of interconnecting power and transportation networks, there has been a surge in attacks targeting power systems, specifically those capable of disrupting charging services. Existing studies on identifying false data injection attacks (FDIAs) are insufficient in safeguarding coupled power-dependent electrified transportation networks for several reasons: (a) they are primarily designed for power networks only, (b) they does not consider the influence of cyber attacks on charging satisfaction rates, and (c) they lack adaptability/do not generalize well to various topological configurations. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper introduces a comprehensive FDIA detection scheme that takes into account the interconnected nature of power-transportation infrastructures, eventually improving the charging user satisfaction rates. Toward this objective, we develop a defense strategy based on a graph autoencoder (GAE) that extracts spatio-temporal features from the intertwined data, thereby providing increased resilience against FDIAs. Furthermore, our model undergoes training on diverse power system topologies and various attack scenarios, ensuring improved generalization capabilities. Simulations were conducted on two types of power systems: one with 2000 buses and another with 30 buses, featuring 360 and 35 charging stations (CSs) respectively. When subjected to unseen data, our model achieved an impressive 98.3% detection rate, marking a significant enhancement of 15% to 30% compared to benchmark strategies. This highlights the efficacy of our proposed method in adequately tackling the challenges associated with detecting FDIAs on interconnected power and transportation networks.","2024-08","2024-12-13 17:29:09","2025-06-16 13:45:23","2024-12-13 17:29:09","1851-1855","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 0 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] ISSN: 2076-1465","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/I9MD734A/Fahim et al. - 2024 - Generalized FDIA Detection in Power Dependent Electrified Transportation Systems.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/ZUNYBG9F/Fahim et al. - 2024 - Generalized FDIA Detection in Power Dependent Electrified Transportation Systems.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/IYLQYR74/10715443.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/NP6MBWPV/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/X38ER623/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/WJTG22VG/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/HPSRLKXA/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/5ZIADANM/page-5.html","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10715443&ref=; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10715443?arnumber=10715443","#done; Graph neural networks; Power; Graph neural network; Network security; Power system; False data injection attacks; Attack detection; Electric vehicles; Power networks; Transportation system; Coupled system; Coupled systems; Satisfaction rates; Transportation network; #cybersecurity","Training; Benchmark testing; Network topology; Data mining; Transportation; Topology; Feature extraction; Detectors; Vehicle dynamics; Surges","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2024 32nd European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The high computational burden of traditional solution methods led to a shift towards data-driven approaches, exploiting the availability of digital metering data. However, data-driven approaches, such as deep learning, have not yet won the trust of operators as they are agnostic to the underlying physical model and have poor performances in regimes with limited observability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a new, physics-informed model. More specifically, a novel physics-informed loss function is developed that can be used to train (deep) neural networks aimed at power flow simulation. The loss function is not only based on the theoretical AC power flow equations that govern the problem but also incorporates real physical line losses, resulting in higher loss accuracy and increased learning potential. The proposed model is used to train a Graph Neural Network (GNN) and is evaluated on a small 3-bus test case both against another physics-informed GNN that does not incorporate physical losses and against a model-free technique. The validation results show that the proposed model outperforms the conventional physics-informed network on all used performance metrics. Even more interesting is that the model shows strong prediction capabilities when tested on scenarios outside the training sample set, something that is a substantial deficiency of model-free techniques. © 2024 IEEE.","2024","2025-04-04 09:36:38","2025-11-25 14:02:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/WWDYLCXK/Eeckhout et al. - 2024 - Improved Physics-Informed Neural Network based AC Power Flow for Distribution Networks.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/4B68639M/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/8UGXQSXB/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/JUY8J22E/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/I6KP95ZN/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/NJSEUSX6/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/5XGMAMTA/display.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/XWWM4J2G/Eeckhout et al. - 2024 - Improved Physics-Informed Neural Network based AC Power Flow for Distribution Networks.pdf; ","https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000010227&origin=SingleRecordEmailAlert&dgcid=raven_sc_search_en_us_email&txGid=1c0fbb941a84246ecf395e9ae9ff5214; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09466","#done; Graph neural networks; Network-based; Power distribution networks; Loss functions; Neural-networks; Data-driven model; Data-driven approach; distribution networks; Physic-informed neural network; physics-informed neural network; DC distribution systems; AC power flow; data-driven model; Digital elevation model; Model free; Model-free technique; model-free techniques; #optimization-control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Europe, ISGT EUROPE 2024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, large-scale power networks consist of thousands of nodes and edges, which complicates the process of learning appropriate node embeddings and aggregating information from neighboring nodes. By representing power grids as undirected weighted graphs, this study proposes a novel power network partitioning approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNN). The proposed model simplifies the clustering objective by focusing on a single balancing term, which reduces computational complexity while maintaining competitive clustering performance. The power network is represented as a graph where the proposed GNN uses the normalized graph Laplacian, which effectively captures the complex connectivity of the nodes, instead of the traditional adjacency matrix. Active power levels serve as nodal attributes, ensuring that clusters represent both the physical and operational characteristics of the network. This dual-focused approach promotes a partitioning that is topologically coherent and functionally homogeneous, vital for enhanced grid management. When applied to the IEEE 14, 39, and 118 bus systems, the proposed method has successfully delineated coherent clusters of buses, underlining its potential for improving power grid management. The simulation results confirm the method’s efficacy and applicability. © 2024 IEEE.","2024","2025-04-04 09:48:58","2025-11-25 21:48:07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","1 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/HLKXFVA2/Eddin et al. - 2024 - Graph Neural Network-Based Node Clustering for Dual-Focused Power Network Partitioning.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/AJD674M8/Eddin et al. - 2024 - Graph Neural Network-Based Node Clustering for Dual-Focused Power Network Partitioning.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/U4D7M9SK/10905473.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/XDXLWJI3/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/568V5RT9/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/ZAYTRCDT/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/PR29I76N/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/UKW3HJW6/page-5.html","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10905473&ref=; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10905473","#done; Power grids; Graph neural networks; Power; Graph neural network; Undirected graphs; Power networks; Clustering; Clusterings; graph neural networks (GNN); Network partitioning; normalized graph Laplacian; Normalized graph Laplacian; power networks; power system partitioning; Power system partitioning; System partitioning; #optimization-control","Power system stability; Technological innovation; Topology; Stability analysis; Simulation; Power system reliability; Reliability; Laplace equations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IECON Proceedings (Industrial Electronics Conference)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is challenging to identify the proper cut-set of transmission lines for network splitting adaptively during real-time operation. To address this problem, this paper proposes a structural deep clustering network (SDCN)-based approach for controlled islanding in power transmission networks to prevent transient instability and widespread blackout. With buses to be nodes and branches to be edges, the graph representation of power network is proposed as the input features for the SDCN model. To ensure that all the islands can operate securely after network splitting, the cross-entropy loss that is related with the classification of the generator buses is introduced into the loss function of the SDCN model so that the generators in each island will be coherent. The procedure of the proposed SDCN-based approach for controlled islanding is then discussed in detail. Case studies on the IEEE 9-bus and 118-bus systems are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and the scalability of the proposed SDCN-based approach.","2024-04","2024-07-17 23:26:34","2025-11-25 21:25:11","2024-07-17 23:41:13","1346-1352","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 0 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/7N2Z6GLX/Ding et al. - 2024 - Controlled Islanding of Power Systems Based on Str.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/EQ46B549/10532619.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/7LZFE2BD/Ding et al. - 2024 - Controlled Islanding of Power Systems Based on Str.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/LMWN2VUS/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/MMQ9P5TE/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/DDFSJ8QD/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/3DDIZNEQ/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/KD2SP9WI/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/JUNTMNLI/display.html; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10532619?arnumber=10532619; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10532619&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9MTA1MzI2MTk=; https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195585612&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=1477fcc933667db11b199b2aa623dcb8&sot=b&sdt=b&s=%28TITLE-ABS-KEY-AUTH%28%22Graph+Neural+Networks%22+AND+%22Power+Systems%22%29%29+AND+ORIG-LOAD-DATE+AFT+1718322338+AND+ORIG-LOAD-DATE+BEF+1718927138++AND+PUBYEAR+AFT+2022&sl=155&sessionSearchId=1477fcc933667db11b199b2aa623dcb8&relpos=2","#done; Graph neural networks; graph neural network; Power; Deep neural networks; Electric power transmission networks; Outages; Electric power transmission; Distributed power generation; Network models; Cascading outages; Clustering networks; coherency; Coherency; controlled islanding; Controlled islanding; Network splitting; Network-based approach; structural deep clustering network.; Structural deep clustering network.; #faults-reliability","Power system stability; Power system protection; Power transmission lines; Generators; Scalability; Power transmission; Islanding","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2024 9th Asia Conference on Power and Electrical Engineering (ACPEE)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many current detection methods only focus on temporal correlations and ignore spatial correlations. To take into account both temporal and spatial features, we proposed to employ Graph Neural Networks (GNN). In fact, to develop a GNN approach that is applicable to the satellite power system anomaly detection in real-world scenarios, it is imperative to take into account the specific requirements of the aerospace industry. Our analysis and research indicate that the critical factors lie in model interpretability and data characteristics. First, as model interpretability can bring trustworthiness, traceability, and guidance, it is indispensable for the application of deep learning algorithms in satellite telemetry data anomaly detection. We created a novel graph filter: Adaptive Quadratic Approximation Graph Filter (AQAGF), which is capable of both approximation ability and response time. It is transformed into a spectral graph convolution neural network that can draw the frequency response function to provide the model interpretability. Then, to address the difficulties of telemetry data characteristics: strong noise and missing data, we introduced autoencoder architecture and adversarial training strategy to further design our anomaly detection method, called Interpretable Spatial-Temporal Graph Anomaly Detection (ISTGAD) based on AQAGF, which is robust to noise and data missing. And it is able to capture temporal and spatial correlations together within a transparent working mechanism. Finally, experiments proved that our model has better anomaly detection performance than other state-of-the-art methods, and we also provide visualizations to showcase the interpretability and working mechanism of our model.

Electrical variables as input variables of the model are mainly considered to indicate the power system operation as secure or insecure, according to the reliability criteria for contingency scenarios. In this approach, the features are in grid format data, where the relation between features and any knowledge of network topology is absent. Moreover, the traditional and common models, such as neural networks (NN), are not applicable if the input variables are in the graph format structure. Therefore, this paper examines the security analysis in the graph neural network (GNN) framework such that the GNN model incorporates the network connection and node's neighbors' influence for the assessment. Here the input features are separated graphs representing different network conditions in electrical and structural statuses. Topological characteristics defined by network centrality measures are added in the feature vector representing the structural properties of the network. The proposed model is simulated in the IEEE 118-Bus system for the voltage static security assessment (SSA). The performance indices validate the efficiency of the GNN-based model compared to the traditional NN model denoting that the information enclosed in graph data boosts the classifier performance since the GNN model benefits the neighbors' features. Moreover, outperforming of GNN-based model is determined when robustness and sensitivity analyzes are carried out. The proposed method is not limited to a specific task and can be extended for other security assessments with different critical variables, such as dynamic analysis and frequency criteria, respectively.","2023-01-30","2024-06-26 09:43:09","2025-11-25 21:42:37","2024-05-08 14:32:25","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","2 citations (Semantic Scholar/arXiv) [2025-04-09] 2 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] arXiv:2301.12988 [cs, eess]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/7C2EKV3D/Dezvarei et al. - 2023 - Graph Neural Network Framework for Security Assess.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/DNXD4HE2/2301.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/YEVHMGXI/Dezvarei et al. - 2023 - Graph Neural Network Framework for Security Assess.ocr.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/M3G9FVVL/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/N5ZVWPRC/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/YRK9PE5M/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/SAAKZAMB/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/992GPZE5/page-5.html","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.12988.pdf; https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12988; notion://www.notion.so/Dezvarei-et-al-2023-59bb410e45644ab09d71256b4a9be7f0","#done; notion; #faults-reliability","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Systems and Control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2301.12988","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We introduce a novel solution to solving alternating current OPF (ACOPF), a nonlinear and nonconvex optimization problem, by combining the speed of a trained deep learning model with the accuracy of iterative solvers. The proposed framework uses a graph neural network (GNN) to exploit the graph structure of a power system in conjunction with proximal policy optimization, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, to compute initial guesses for an interior point solver (IPS), providing a warm start, allowing the solver to converge in fewer iterations. Existing literature that explores warm start ACOPF solutions using machine learning choose to compute initial guesses that are trained to be feasible and cost-minimizing. Our approach trains the GNN-based reinforcement learning agent to produce an output that minimizes IPS convergence time by designing a reward function that is a function of the IPS convergence time. We evaluate the proposed framework using IEEE test case environments, using PyPower's IPS-based ACOPF solver and a GNN-based framework that computes ACOPF solutions directly as baselines, demonstrating significantly improved convergence times. © 2024 The Author(s)","2024","2024-07-17 23:23:51","2025-06-15 18:46:30","","","","","234","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","2 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 1 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 1 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/G7H2ZU34/Deihim et al. - 2024 - Initial estimate of AC optimal power flow with gra.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/9JXH7L5L/Deihim et al. - 2024 - Initial estimate of AC optimal power flow with gra.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/KRKFK7RD/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/GFV7UJ24/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/MQBLWEUS/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/MDV4W95P/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/8FGHUHIA/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/U54GZSP2/display.html; ","https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196824966&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=311b559704c16265140408501ce3b740&sot=b&sdt=b&s=%28TITLE-ABS-KEY-AUTH%28%22Graph+Neural+Networks%22+AND+%22Power+Systems%22%29%29+AND+ORIG-LOAD-DATE+AFT+1719531938+AND+ORIG-LOAD-DATE+BEF+1720136738++AND+PUBYEAR+AFT+2022&sl=155&sessionSearchId=311b559704c16265140408501ce3b740&relpos=0","#done; Graph neural networks; Deep learning; Reinforcement learning; Electric load flow; Graphic methods; Flow graphs; Learning algorithms; Power control; Acoustic generators; Optimal power flows; Iterative methods; AC optimal power flow; Alternating current; Convergence time; Initial estimate; Initial guess; Interior point; Proximal policy approximation; Warm start; #optimization-control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is an effective approach to track the cloud motion during short-term PV power forecasting based on data sources of satellite images. However, since temporal variations of these images are noisy and non-stationary, pixel-sensitive prediction methods are critically needed in order to seek a balance between the forecast precision and the huge computation burden due to a large image size. Hence, a graphical learning framework is proposed in this study for intra-hour PV power prediction. By simulating the cloud motion using bi-directional extrapolation, a directed graph is generated representing the pixel values from multiple frames of historical images. The nodes and edges in the graph denote the shapes and motion directions of the regions of interest (ROIs) in satellite images. A spatial-temporal graph neural network (GNN) is then proposed to deal with the graph. Comparing with conventional deep-learning-based models, GNN is more flexible for varying sizes of input, in order to be able to handle dynamic ROIs. Referring to the comparative studies, the proposed method greatly reduces the redundancy of image inputs without sacrificing the visual scope, and slightly improves the prediction accuracy.","2022-05","2024-06-26 09:43:09","2025-11-26 09:35:48","2024-05-08 15:32:30","2335-2345","","3","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","49 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-11-26] 34 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 39 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 37 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/QNVKTPEW/Cheng et al. - 2022 - Solar Power Prediction Based on Satellite Measurem.ocr.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/Q8MT6CT4/9568736.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/L4TS4JUW/Cheng et al. - 2022 - Solar Power Prediction Based on Satellite Measurem.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/PJMNVBYU/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/JSAJCPKH/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/9N29PEAU/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/6CKEKTUU/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/9JR6YDAF/page-5.html","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9568736; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9568736&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL2Fic3RyYWN0L2RvY3VtZW50Lzk1Njg3MzY=; notion://www.notion.so/Cheng-et-al-2022-6d2d547576f24d678b3d3e9794a76b24","#done; notion; #forecasting","Forecasting; Predictive models; deep learning; Clouds; Satellites; Bidirectional control; Brightness temperature; Extrapolation; graphical learning; satellite images; Solar PV power prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Conventional admittance-matrix-based power grid topological models have been illustrated to lack analytical capabilities to effectively model ubiquitous flexibility, capacity, and prosumer profiles and enable granular and accurate controls of the ultrahigh-dimensional distributed energy resources. In this work, we propose a novel Multi-View Topological Neural Networks (MV-TopoNets), a class of simple yet effective topological deep learning built upon persistent homology, topological convolution, and graph convolution operations. The proposed MV-TopoNets model aims to integrate ubiquitous and high-dimensional information structures on transmission nodes by taking properties of power systems as special directions, and designs new perspectives at the intersection of algebraic topology, commutative algebra, and deep learning for power system contingency analysis. Real data experiments show that the proposed MV-TopoNets outperforms 7 state-of-the-art methods on two power grid datasets. © 2024 IEEE.","2024","2024-11-14 14:25:21","2025-11-17 19:12:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 0 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/NX2LANJM/Chen et al. - 2024 - Learning Power System Vulnerabilities through Multi-View Topological Neural Networks.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/KV8A859P/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/RP79TKY7/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/FNPJQG4N/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/NGXJJRTH/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/MTHMF6SS/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/HSS2ZT24/Chen et al. - 2024 - Learning Power System Vulnerabilities through Multi-View Topological Neural Networks.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/BNFPEVKZ/display.html","https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207389864&origin=SingleRecordEmailAlert&dgcid=raven_sc_search_en_us_email&txGid=e3f831d242614b0bcc36a99aa2d82a21","#done; Power grids; Graph neural networks; Graph Neural Networks; Network topology; Power; Neural-networks; Admittance matrices; Large-scales; Multi-views; Physical assets; Power system vulnerability; Power System Vulnerability; Topological data analysis; Topological Data Analysis; #faults-reliability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, existing methods often suffer from the lack of domain knowledge and the limited ability to capture complex correlations within the graph data. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel method for anomaly detection in power energy topology graph data based on domain knowledge graph and Graph Neural Network (GNN). Firstly, we construct a domain knowledge graph that incorporates expert knowledge and prior information about power energy systems. Then, we utilize the GNN model to learn the representations of nodes and edges in the graph data, capturing their complex relationships. Finally, we apply anomaly detection algorithms on the learned graph representations to identify potential anomalies in power energy topology. Experimental results on realworld power energy datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. In conclusion, our method provides a promising approach for more accurate and reliable anomaly detection in power energy topology, contributing to the improvement of power system security and stability. © 2024 IEEE.","2024","2024-07-31 11:15:53","2025-11-26 09:20:24","","107-112","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-11-26] 0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 0 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/KXHXPFFX/Chen et al. - 2024 - A Method for Anomaly Detection in Power Energy Top.ocr.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/KRGDHR9J/10565196.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/CZ3KVL4G/Chen et al. - 2024 - A Method for Anomaly Detection in Power Energy Top.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/S845FK9V/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/JCVU2WFF/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/3XTTWXIY/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/6XHFNHEW/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/HLWHIM6Z/page-5.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/3R97HHZX/display.html","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10565196?arnumber=10565196; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10565196&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9MTA1NjUxOTY=; https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197725145&origin=SingleRecordEmailAlert&dgcid=raven_sc_search_en_us_email&txGid=63e03f18ded08f4521a42616a4ca4436","#done; Graph neural networks; Graph neural network; Anomaly detection; Topology; Complex networks; Knowledge graphs; Anomaly Detection; Knowledge graph; Domain knowledge; Domain Knowledge; Domain knowledge graph; Domain Knowledge Graph; Energy topology; Graph Neural Network (GNN); Power energy; Power energy topology; Power Energy Topology; Power System Security; Power systems security; #faults-reliability; #data-management","Network topology; Power system stability; Stability analysis; Power system reliability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Proceedings - 2024 IEEE 10th Conference on Big Data Security on Cloud, BigDataSecurity 2024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This leads to more diversified types of faults in the distribution network, so it is crucial to optimize its topology. In this paper, we first compare the main connection modes of high-voltage and medium-voltage distribution networks in China, and combine them with the specific needs of Shaanxi Power Grid to propose a differentiated flexible network model and its scope of application. Using Graph Neural Network and Genetic Algorithm, an innovative optimization method of distribution network connection is proposed to support the typical network structure of the new distribution network. Analysis of examples shows that the proposed algorithm can improve the original network’s network loss and voltage deviation by 32.8% and 37.3%, respectively, and the improvement effect is better than that of the traditional genetic algorithm. At the same time, considering the different stages of distribution network development and the uncertainties that may be faced, this paper also explores the flexible transition scheme of each typical network structure to ensure a smooth transition to a more efficient, green and intelligent distribution network model without affecting the reliability of the existing power supply. © 2025 River Publishers.","2024","2025-04-04 09:37:40","2025-11-26 09:34:41","","1179-1208","","6","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-11-26] 0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/MHJITUCD/Chen et al. - 2024 - Research on Optimization of Distribution Network Connection Mode Based on Graph Neural Network and G.ocr.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/TRL8NTFI/Chen et al. - 2024 - Research on Optimization of Distribution Network Connection Mode Based on Graph Neural Network and G.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/7Z9C6V7Q/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/9FT6HAJE/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/FTKQAGHT/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/KEJ4NFFJ/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/KR4G3KT8/page-5.html","https://journals.riverpublishers.com/index.php/DGAEJ/article/download/27193/21345","#done; Graph neural networks; Power distribution faults; Power distribution networks; graph neural network; Optimisations; Genetic algorithms; Network models; Connection mode; genetic algorithm; Network structures; DC distribution systems; connection mode; Distribution network; model parameter optimization; Power distribution reliability; Deep integrations; Mode-based; Model parameter optimization; Network connection; Neural networks and genetic algorithms; #optimization-control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Contrary to the detection of these attacks, less attention has been paid to identifying the attacked units of the grid. To this end, this work jointly studies detecting and localizing the stealth FDIA in power grids. Exploiting the inherent graph topology of power systems as well as the spatial correlations of measurement data, this paper proposes an approach based on the graph neural network (GNN) to identify the presence and location of the FDIA. The proposed approach leverages the auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) type graph filters (GFs) which can better adapt to sharp changes in the spectral domain due to their rational type filter composition compared to the polynomial type GFs such as Chebyshev. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work based on GNN that automatically detects and localizes FDIA in power systems. Extensive simulations and visualizations show that the proposed approach outperforms the available methods in both detection and localization of FDIA for different IEEE test systems. Thus, the targeted areas can be identified and preventive actions can be taken before the attack impacts the grid.","2022-01","2024-06-26 09:43:09","2025-11-17 19:10:27","2024-04-18 12:18:23","807-819","","1","13","","IEEE Trans.

These data-driven models are well-suited for analysis of large exploration spaces, historical event data, and online cascade prediction compared to computationally expensive physics-based methods. Moreover, propagation of failure is commonly observed in physical systems, preceding a cascading failure that occasionally results in widespread failure events such as blackouts in power grids. Considering such failure trends, we aim to investigate the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for the analysis and prediction of cascading failures in power systems by means of information propagation. We focus on data-driven modeling and formulate end-to-end mechanisms to train models capable of predicting the cascading effects of various failure-inducing events introduced to power grid profiles. Unlike physics-based models that require iterative power flow solutions, we predict post-event grid component vulnerability based only on the initiating events and network operational status. We evaluate several representative GNN models in this framework. We also formulate a graph convolution mechanism to perform message-passing between power grid components using both bus and branch features. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of GNN-based methods for end-to-end cascading failure prediction on the IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus test systems.","2024-06","2024-10-28 13:53:14","2025-11-17 23:37:24","2024-10-28 13:53:14","1-7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 0 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] ISSN: 2161-4407","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/J3BRE7FI/Bhaila and Wu - 2024 - Cascading Failure Prediction in Power Grid Using Node and Edge Attributed Graph Neural Networks.ocr.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/D2APKUIT/Bhaila and Wu - 2024 - Cascading Failure Prediction in Power Grid Using Node and Edge Attributed Graph Neural Networks.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/TATQMQ5L/10650986.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/H85VQBKR/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/PVKU52MX/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/PPI85VZQ/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/VC4WZ452/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/LV6X24R3/page-5.html","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10650986&ref=; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10650986?arnumber=10650986","#done; Power grids; graph neural networks; Graph neural networks; Power; Network security; Attributed graphs; cascading failures; Cascading failures; Data-driven methods; Data-driven model; Electric load flow; Failures prediction; Grid components; Network theory (graphs); power grids; Prediction models; Probabilistic data; #faults-reliability","Predictive models; Market research; Power system protection; Probabilistic logic; Space exploration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2024 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our approach leverages the inherent physical knowledge of power systems through the integration of different physical constraints inside the model architecture and loss function.

When taking a recourse action under such uncertainty, operators must solve a large number of power flow problems in a short period of time, which is time-consuming for large networks. However, many of these recourse actions may lead to infeasible power flow without solutions. This paper explores the applicability of graph neural networks (GNNs) in determining the feasibility of the DC power flow problem to shrink the feasible search space. GNNs can capture the underlying topological and physical constraints inherent in power systems and offer a potentially efficient and scalable solution technique. Our results highlight the capabilities of GNNs as a universal approximator for power flow feasibility. We propose a framework to represent the feasibility of DC power flow problems with line contingencies as linear programs modeled by graph neural networks. In the framework, we project the parameters of the power flow into the design of the graph and its feature space and prove that such representation can distinguish between feasible and infeasible power flow. Numerical simulations are performed with load and topology variations in the IEEE-9 and IEEE-39 test cases. The results validate the theory, showing that GNN outperforms other deep learning architectures. © 2024 IEEE.","2024","2024-11-14 14:25:34","2025-11-25 21:08:06","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 0 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/KBISIA2K/Alduaij et al. - 2024 - Determining Feasibility of DC Power Flow Using Graph Neural Networks.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/QXV46BCU/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/L88XJMDA/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/LCVGKHGR/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/4FGUEZAI/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/4EBH3ZY4/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/TTS9XECB/Alduaij et al. - 2024 - Determining Feasibility of DC Power Flow Using Graph Neural Networks.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/RI5RTANC/display.html","https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207405916&origin=SingleRecordEmailAlert&dgcid=raven_sc_search_en_us_email&txGid=80c2617f3421a673453759dbe656ddfa","#done; Graph neural networks; Graph neural network; DC power flow; Deep learning; done; Linear programs; Linear Programs; Load flow control; Load flow optimization; Operating condition; Power flow; Power flow problem; Power flows; Renewables; Short periods; Uncertainty; #grid-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional methods of topology identification lack a data-tolerant mechanism, and the accuracy of their performance in terms of identification is thus affected by the quality of data. Topology identification is related to the link prediction problem. The graph neural network can be used to predict the state of unlabeled nodes (lines) through training on features of labeled nodes (lines) with fault tolerance. Inspired by the characteristics of the graph neural network, we apply it to topology identification in this study. We propose a method to identify the topology of a power network based on a knowledge graph and the graph neural network. Traditional knowledge graphs can quickly mine possible connections between entities and generate graph structure data, but in case of errors or informational conflicts in the data, they cannot accurately determine whether the relationships between the entities really exist. The graph neural network can use data mining to determine whether a connection obtains between entities based on their eigenvalues, and has a fault tolerance mechanism to adapt to errors and informational conflicts in the graph data, but needs the graph data as database. The combination of the knowledge graph and the graph neural network can compensate for the deficiency of the single knowledge graph method.We tested the proposed method by using the IEEE 118-bus system and a provincial network system. The results showed that our approach is feasible and highly fault tolerant. It can accurately identify network topology even in the presence of conflicting and missing measurement-related information.","2021-02-17","2024-06-26 09:43:42","2025-11-25 13:58:40","2024-05-15 19:47:30","","","","8","","Front.

Their management and associated forecasting of produced energy are tasks of increasing complexity. Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks have been applied in this context with excellent results, taking advantage of the correct integration of both topological data, defined by the distribution of the plants in the territory, and temporal data of the time series. A drawback of graph neural networks is the recurrent mechanism adopted to process the temporal part, which increases greatly the computational load of these models. Moreover, these models are formulated for real and sensitive contexts where, in addition to being accurate, the predictions must also be understandable by the human operator. For these reasons, in this paper we propose a novel explainable energy forecasting framework based on Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks: the forecasting model generates predictions by processing temporal and spatial information using a spectral graph convolution and a 1D convolutional neural network respectively, then we apply a state-of-the-art explainer to them in order to produce explanations about the generation process. Our proposed method obtains predictions having better performance than previous approaches, both in terms of computational efficiency and prediction accuracy, with the possibility of interpreting them in order to understand the generation process. The novel approach based on fusion of forecasting and explainability in a single framework enables the creation of powerful and reliable systems suitable for real-world issues and challenges. © 2023 The Author(s)","2024","2024-06-26 09:43:42","2025-11-17 19:09:29","","","","","353","","Appl.

By performing power flow calculations, the system's steady-state variables, including voltage magnitude, phase angle at each bus, and active/reactive power flow across branches, can be determined. While the widely used DC power flow model offers speed and robustness, it may yield inaccurate line flow results for certain transmission lines. This issue becomes more critical when dealing with renewable energy sources such as wind farms, which are often located far from the main grid. Obtaining precise line flow results for these critical lines is vital for next operations. To address these challenges, data-driven approaches leverage historical grid profiles. In this paper, a graph neural network (GNN) model is trained using historical power system data to predict power flow outcomes. The GNN model enables rapid estimation of line flows. A comprehensive performance analysis is conducted, comparing the proposed GNN-based power flow model with the traditional DC power flow model, as well as deep neural network (DNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN).

In such a complex network, node tamper detection needs to consider a variety of combinations and connection modes, which increases the complexity of the problem. Therefore, a new method of topological node tamper detection based on fuzzy graph theory is proposed. The feature difference values of topological nodes are extracted according to the node tampering feature vector. Detection of topological node similarity based on fuzzy graph-neural network. Based on this, the cost function of topological node tampering is established to obtain the Bayesian estimate of the tampering coefficient of the topological node transmission channel, and the detection of topological node tampering is completed.

Several approaches have been investigated to counter such false data injection attacks (FDIAs). However, such data-driven detectors present two major limitations. First, they neglect capturing the grid’s spatial characteristics. Second, they offer limited attack identification to familiar types of FDIAs since they are present within the model’s train sets. To conquer such limitations, we propose the use of an artificial intelligence-based graph autoencoder (GAE) for FDIAs detection. Our proposed detector offers three main advantages compared to existing detectors. First, it employs the operation of graph convolution to apprehend the grid’s spatial characteristics. Second, it offers an unsupervised autoencoder-based anomaly detection that requires only benign samples under normal operation for training. Third, it outperforms existing detectors by 16–47% in FDIAs detection rate (DR) when tested against unseen FDIAs on an IEEE 39-bus system. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2024","2024-06-26 09:43:42","2025-06-15 19:18:42","2023-09-07","","234","","822","","","","Intelligent Systems Conference, IntelliSys 2023","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

Recent efforts have focused on developing machine learning (ML)-based defense strategies against such attacks. However, existing strategies offer limited detection performance since they (a) lack the capability of embedding the spatial aspects of the power system topology in the detection mechanism, (b) offer topology-specific detection that does not generalize well to practical systems with seasonal reconfigurations in their topology, or (c) offer detection based on only seen types of FDIAs present in the training set. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to develop a defense strategy that offers an improved generalization ability and detection performance against unseen attacks. Towards this objective, we propose a graph autoencoder (GAE)-based detection strategy that (a) captures spatio-temporal features of power systems, hence, offering improved detection performance, (b) is trained on comprehensive graphs reflecting various realizations of power system topologies, hence, offering better generalization abilities, and (c) works effectively against unseen FDIAs. The proposed detector is trained and tested on various topological configurations from 14, 39, and 118-bus systems offering detection rates (DRs) of 93.6%, 95.7%, and 99.1%, respectively, when tested against unseen FDIAs and unseen topologies. This presents an improvement of 11.5 - 30% compared to existing ML-based strategies. © 2017 IEEE.","2023","2024-06-26 09:43:42","2025-11-17 19:10:39","","618-630","","3","7","","IEEE Trans.

Hence, it is important that advancements are made in intrusion detection systems (IDSs). Recently, promising results have been reported using deep machine learning techniques to develop effective IDSs. However, the existing studies suffer from the following limitations: (a) The adoption of either only physical features (power system measurements) or only cyber features (network logs) in the development of IDSs; (b) The adoption of deep learning techniques that operate on 2D data, while power system measurements are graph-structure data. In this paper, we address these limitations and propose an effective IDS against false data injection and ransomware attacks. Our proposed IDS improves the attack detection performance by (a) fusing cyber-physical features collected from a practical testbed and (b) adopting a topology-aware model based on a graph neural network (GNN) to exploit the spatial and temporal correlation within the data. Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our IDS compared with benchmarks that are based on topology-unaware models and use solely cyber or physical data. © 2023 IEEE.","2023","2024-06-26 09:43:42","2025-11-17 19:06:07","2023-10-31","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","4 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 3 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 2 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Int.

However, short-term load forecasting is affected by multiple factors, and due to the complexity of the relationships between factors, the graph structure in this task is unknown. On the other hand, existing methods do not fully aggregating data information through the inherent relationships between various factors. In this paper, we propose a short-term load forecasting framework based on graph neural networks and dilated 1D-CNN, called GLFN-TC. GLFN-TC uses the graph learning module to automatically learn the relationships between variables to solve problem with unknown graph structure. GLFN-TC effectively handles temporal and spatial dependencies through two modules. In temporal convolution module, GLFN-TC uses dilated 1D-CNN to extract temporal dependencies from historical data of each node. In densely connected residual convolution module, in order to ensure that data information is not lost, GLFN-TC uses the graph convolution of densely connected residual to make full use of the data information of each graph convolution layer. Finally, the predicted values are obtained through the load forecasting module. We conducted five studies to verify the outperformance of GLFN-TC. In short-term load forecasting, using MSE as an example, the experimental results of GLFN-TC decreased by 0.0396, 0.0137, 0.0358, 0.0213 and 0.0337 compared to the optimal baseline method on ISO-NE, AT, AP, SH and NCENT datasets, respectively. Results show that GLFN-TC can achieve higher prediction accuracy than the existing common methods. © 2023, The Author(s).","2023","2024-06-26 09:43:42","2025-06-15 18:37:49","","","","","","","Data Sci.

Accurate Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) is the important factor for short-term PV power forecasting. However, the accuracy of NWP is sometimes unsatisfactory. Meanwhile, due to various reasons, there were many kinds of anomalies in the measured data of photovoltaic stations, which will lead to the difficulty in obtaining accurate enough forecasting results. In this paper, a NWP correction method considering the coupling correlation of meteorological factors and a short-term photovoltaic power forecasting model based on the correction results are proposed to further improve the prediction accuracy. Firstly, the anomalies are detected and eliminated. Secondly, the optimal forecasting model is trained with the measured meteorological data and power data, meanwhile the optimal combination of meteorological factors is determined. Finally, a short-term PV power forecasting model based on convolutional long-short term memory network (CNN-LSTM) is established. The simulation results show that, compared with the method without optimal meteorological factors determination and NWP correction, the accuracy can be significantly improved by proposed method in this paper. The necessity and effectiveness of NWP correction are also verified. © 2023 IEEE.","2023","2024-07-31 11:06:16","2025-11-26 09:21:01","2023-05-21","","","","2023-May","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","3 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-11-26] 3 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 1 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 1 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] Journal Abbreviation: Conf.

Existing studies have utilized deep learning techniques to enhance the detection of FDIAs, however, these studies often overlook the spatial correlation between power grid topology and measurement data. Meanwhile, the high complexity of deep neural network severely impedes the interpretability of detection models, resulting in the incredibility of detection results. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes an interpretable deep learning FDIAs detection method, named dual-attention multi-head graph attention network, DAMGAT. The DAMGAT introduces a dual-attention mechanism that incorporates both node feature attention and spatial topology attention into a multi-head graph attention network. This mechanism efficiently aggregates attack characteristics and spatial topology information by dynamically capturing the potential correlations between FDIAs detection and measurement data. Furthermore, the proposed model can provide clear and credible interpretations for high-accuracy detection results via analyzing features and spatial topology attention weights. Extensive simulations are performed using the IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus test systems. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art FDIA detection methods in terms of accuracy, while also providing reasonable interpretability for features and spatial dimensions.

Today, it is usually formulated and solved as a mixed-integer program. To ensure robustness against operational contingencies, a large number of security constraints must be considered, which significantly increases the problem’s complexity. However, only a small subset of these constraints is typically active in the solution. Conventional solving approaches attempt to eliminate redundant security constraints through a computationally expensive iterative search. In this paper, we study machine learning approaches to alleviate this search by predicting a set of relevant security constraints to retain. We propose a new neural network architecture based on graph convolutions and the attention mechanism, which we evaluate on synthetic unit commitment problems for nine power grids. Compared to the conventional iterative approach and previous machine learning-based methods, our architecture improves average and (more importantly) worst-case solving times by a factor of 2 to 3. © 2023 IEEE.","2023","2024-07-31 11:06:16","2025-11-25 20:37:45","2023-10-23","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Computer Society","","English","","","Scopus","","","","1 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 0 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] Journal Abbreviation: IEEE PES Innovative.

By leveraging the graph neural network (GNN), the proposed scalable graph learning mechanism with random coarse graph attention and probabilistic spatio-temporal learning performs efficiently for large-scale PV sites in terms of forecasting accuracy and model training complexity.

To address the limited resolution and costs of methods based on numerical weather predictions (NWP), we take PV production data as main input for forecasting. Since PV power is affected by weather and cloud dynamics, we model spatio-temporal correlations between production data by representing PV systems as nodes of a dynamic graph and embedding production data, geographical information and clear-sky irradiance as signals on that graph. We introduce a new temporal-spatial multi-windows graph attention network (TSM-GAT) for predicting future PV power production. TSM-GAT can adapt to the dynamics of the problem, by learning different graphs over time. It consists of temporal attention with an overlapping-window mechanism that finds the temporal correlations and spatial attention with a multi-window mechanism, which captures different dynamical spatio-temporal correlations for different parts of the forecasting horizon. Thus, it is possible to interpret which PV stations have the most influence when making a prediction for short-, medium- and long-term intra-day forecasts. TSM-GAT outperforms multi-site state-of-the-art models for four to six hours ahead predictions, with average NRMSE 12.4% and 10.5% on a real and synthetic dataset, respectively. Furthermore, it outperforms state-of-the-art models that use NWP as inputs for up to five hours ahead predictions. TSM-GAT yields predicted signals with a closer shape to ground truth than state-of-the-art models, which indicates that it is better at capturing cloud motion and may lead to better generalization capabilities. © 2022 The Author(s)","2022","2024-06-26 09:43:42","2025-11-17 19:10:36","","","","","327","","Appl.

With the replacement of a high percentage of new energy, the voltage and power angle problems are closely coupled, so an integrated assessment method that takes into account the rapidity, accuracy and stability is urgently needed to deal with the system risks. In order to solve this problem, firstly, we propose a multi-task spatio-temporal graph neural network model based on two-stage ensemble learning (TSEL-MT-STGNN) for integrated assessment of TAS&TVS. In the first stage of this model, the topological spatial features of the system are extracted through multi-type graph neural networks, and the obtained knowledge is input to the gated recurrent unit (GRU) for further temporal feature extraction, so as to achieve spatio-temporal information fusion. In this stage, TAS and TVS were combined through the multi-task framework to achieve integrated assessment under the shared features. In the second stage, meta-learner multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used to fuse the output results of multi-type spatio-temporal graph neural network. Secondly, an integrated assessment method is proposed based on the model, which enables end-to-end assessment, and gives the stability result and safety margin of the system in the current state without knowing the fault clearing time. Thirdly, in order to ensure the timeliness of the assessment method, a multi-graph parallel training scheme is proposed to accelerate the training process. By introducing time constrained loss function and dynamic weight training, the response time is greatly reduced on the basis of maintaining the existing accuracy, thus achieving advance assessment. Finally, the improved New England 39-bus system is taken as an example for verification and analysis. The results show that the proposed method can achieve high-precision advance assessment of TAS&TVS, and has strong robustness and anti-noise capability. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We scrutinize a range of techniques, encompassing Auto-Encoder Method, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), Deep Belief Network (DBN), Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Attention Mechanisms, and Hybrid Models. This article introduces and reviews common deep-learning algorithms used in load forecasting for smart grids and power systems. It also offers a comparative assessment based on the reduction percentage in four indicators: accuracy, speed, mean absolute error (MAPE), and root mean square error (RMSE).

However, the optimal allocation of distributed energy resources (DERs) in electrical distribution systems still pertains as a challenging issue to attain the maximum benefits. It happens due to the system’s complex behaviour and inappropriate integration of DERs that adversely affects the distribution grid. In this work, we propose a methodology for the optimal allocation of DERs with vulnerable node identification in active electrical distribution networks. A failure or extreme event at the vulnerable node would interrupt the power flow in the distribution network. Also, the power variation in these vulnerable nodes would significantly affect the operation of other linked nodes. Thus, these nodes are found suitable for the optimal placement of DERs. We demonstrate the proposed data-driven approach on a standard IEEE-123 bus test feeder. Initially, we partitioned the distribution system into optimal microgrids using graph theory and graph neural network architecture. Further, using Granger causality analysis, we identified vulnerable nodes in the partitioned microgrid, suitable for DERs integration. The placement of DERs on the vulnerable nodes enhanced network resilience. Improvement in resilience is validated by computing the percolation threshold for the microgrid networks.

These attacks are particularly perilous due to the minimal Euclidean spatial separation between the injected malicious data and legitimate data, rendering their precise detection challenging using conventional distance-based methods. Furthermore, existing research predominantly focuses on various machine learning techniques, often analyzing the temporal data sequences post-attack or relying solely on Euclidean spatial characteristics. Unfortunately, this approach tends to overlook the inherent topological correlations within the non-Euclidean spatial attributes of power grid data, consequently leading to diminished accuracy in attack localization. To address this issue, this study takes a comprehensive approach. Initially, it examines the underlying principles of these new DDIAs on power systems. Here, an intricate mathematical model of the DDIA is designed, accounting for incomplete topological knowledge and alternating current (AC) state estimation from an attacker's perspective. This model aims to mitigate the vulnerabilities associated with direct current (DC) flow-based attack data generation methods that can be readily detected. Subsequently, by integrating a priori knowledge of grid topology and considering the temporal correlations within measurement data and the topology-dependent attributes of the power grid, this study introduces temporal and spatial attention matrices. These matrices adaptively capture the spatio-temporal correlations within the attacks. Leveraging gated stacked causal convolution and graph wavelet sparse convolution, the study jointly extracts spatio-temporal DDIA features. This methodology significantly enhances the dynamic correlation mining capability while improving computational efficiency in the neighborhood. Finally, the research proposes a DDIA localization method based on spatio-temporal graph neural networks, allowing for adaptation to changing power system topologies. The accuracy and effectiveness of the DDIA model are rigorously demonstrated through comprehensive analytical cases. It is unequivocally verified that the proposed localization method rapidly and effectively detects and locates DDIA while exhibiting superior accuracy, robustness, and generalization capabilities. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","2024","2024-06-26 09:43:42","2025-11-17 19:10:43","","","","","360","","Appl.

These edge nodes lack strong network protection and security protocols, which can easily become weaknesses in network attacks and increase the risk of power systems. Attackers may use these weak links to invade the power supply chain system, causing adverse effects on power supply and distribution. In order to effectively identify malicious traffic, we propose an anomaly detection method based on attribute graphs to identify potential security vulnerabilities in power IoT traffic. This method utilizes the node representation of the attribute graph to extract features from network traffic, and uses a graph neural network based on meta paths to learn the topological structure and attribute information of the traffic network. In order to ensure the performance of the model in large-scale power IoT nodes, a data accuracy adjustment strategy based on Hoffman encoding was developed to optimize data and adjust the size of attribute maps under different data sizes. The effectiveness of this method was verified through experiments on real network traffic datasets. © 2023 IEEE.","2023","2024-07-31 11:06:16","2025-11-26 09:22:33","2023-10-20","83-86","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","2 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-11-26] 0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-11-26] 0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] Journal Abbreviation: Int.

While machine learning is effective for residential STLF, data and resource limitations hinder individual household predictions operated on local devices. In contrast, utility companies have access to broader sets of data as well as to better computational resources, and thus have the potential to deploy complex forecasting models such as Graph neural network-based models to explore the spatial-temporal relationships between households for achieving impressive STLF performance. In this work, we propose an efficient and privacy-conservative knowledge distillation-based STLF framework. This framework can improve the STLF forecasting accuracy of lightweight individual household forecasting models via leveraging the benefits of knowledge distillation and graph neural networks (GNN). Specifically, we distill the knowledge learned from a GNN model pre-trained on utility data sets into individual models without the need to access data sets of other households. Extensive experiments on real-world residential electric load datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Electric load forecasting can be formulated as a multi-variate time series problem. Residential houses in the same neighborhood may be affected by similar factors and share some latent spatial dependencies. However, most of the existing works on electric load forecasting fail to explore such dependencies. In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown impressive success in modeling such dependencies. However, such GNN based models usually would require a large amount of training data. We may have a minimal amount of data available to train a reliable forecasting model for houses in a new neighborhood area. At the same time, we may have a large amount of historical data collected from other houses that can be leveraged to improve the new neighborhood's prediction performance. In this paper, we propose an attentive transfer learning-based GNN model that can utilize the learned prior knowledge to improve the learning process in a new area. The transfer process is achieved by an attention network, which generically avoids negative transfer by leveraging knowledge from multiple sources. Extensive experiments have been conducted on real-world data sets. Results have shown that the proposed framework can consistently outperform baseline models in different areas. © 2021 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

This problem poses significant analytical and computational challenges. Currently, the state-of-the-art optimization method relies on convex restrictions as tractable approximations to ensure robustness against Gaussian channel uncertainties. However, this method not only exhibits high computational complexity and suffers from the rank relaxation issue but also yields conservative solutions. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised deep learning-based approach that incorporates the sampling of channel uncertainties in the training process to optimize the probabilistic system performance. We introduce a model-driven learning approach that defines a new beamforming structure with trainable parameters to account for channel uncertainties. Additionally, we employ a graph neural network to efficiently infer the key beamforming parameters. We successfully apply this approach to the minimum rate quantile maximization problem subject to outage and total power constraints. Furthermore, we propose a bisection search method to address the more challenging power minimization problem with probabilistic rate constraints by leveraging the aforementioned approach. Numerical results confirm that our approach achieves non-conservative robust performance, higher data rates, greater power efficiency, and faster execution compared to state-of-the-art optimization methods.

FDIA affect the accuracy of data by modifying the measured values of measuring equipment. When the power grid topology has not changed, the data-driven detection method has high detection accuracy. However, the power grid topology changes when faults, maintenance or adjustment in power flow distribution occur in the power system. The data-driven detection method can not capture the spatial feature changes, and the detection accuracy decreases. Considering the changes of power grid topology, a false data detection method based on graph neural network is proposed in this paper, which extracts the spatial features of power grid topology information and operation data through gated graph neural network (GGNN). To enhance node representation in this method, the attention mechanism is adopted to assign aggregation weights to neighbor nodes. This method is tested on IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems. The experimental simulation results show that compared with other data-driven detection methods, the proposed method can significantly improve the detection accuracy under the changes of power grid topology. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","2023","2024-06-26 09:43:27","2025-11-17 19:10:42","","","","","263","","Energy","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","32 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 33 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 33 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/XFN9Y2QH/Li et al. - 2023 - Graph-based detection for false data injection att.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/H5IG4LRG/Li et al. - 2023 - Graph-based detection for false data injection att.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/A27LJN44/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/ST28ADFM/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/MBNZXNWS/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/AK8QIQBG/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/FGA79RQ7/page-5.html","notion://www.notion.so/Li-et-al-2023-24b9269e9c434aefb8b520fdc265265a","#done; Power grids; Graph neural networks; Network security; Attention mechanism; Attention mechanisms; Electric load flow; Graphic methods; Topology; False data injection attacks; Attack detection; Electric power transmission networks; Feature extraction; Data driven; State estimation; artificial neural network; Grid topology; Detection methods; Power systems security; detection method; Electric power system security; equipment; estimation method; False data injection attack detection; False data injection attacks detection; performance assessment; Power system security; simulation; #cybersecurity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through mining feature information of MMKGs, entities are aligned to tackle the issue that an MMKG is incapable of effective integration. The recent attempt at neighbors and attribute fusion mainly focuses on aggregating multi-modal attributes, neglecting the structure effect with multi-modal attributes for entity alignment. This paper proposes an innovative approach, namely TRIFAC, to exploit embedding refinement for factorizing the original multi-modal knowledge graphs through a two-stage MMKG factorization. Notably, we propose triplet-aware graph neural networks to aggregate multi-relational features. We propose multi-modal fusion for aggregating multiple features and design three novel metrics to measure knowledge graph factorization performance on the unified factorized latent space. Empirical results indicate the effectiveness of TRIFAC, surpassing previous state-of-the-art models on two MMEA datasets and a power system dataset. © 2024","2024","2025-04-04 10:01:32","2025-11-26 09:37:58","","","","","179","","Neural Netw.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","21 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-11-26] 5 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 3 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/YSKF888H/Li et al. - 2024 - Triplet-aware graph neural networks for factorized multi-modal knowledge graph entity alignment.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/39MLGFG3/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/GJKSQHG3/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/QFJNC5FG/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/LYV55J9A/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/ULCQI669/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/K2DQSZXH/Li et al. - 2024 - Triplet-aware graph neural networks for factorized multi-modal knowledge graph entity alignment.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/2GJBTKTQ/S0893608024004039.html; ","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608024004039","#done; Graph neural networks; Graph representation; Graph representation learning; artificial neural network; article; feature learning (machine learning); human; algorithm; benchmarking; Feature information; Knowledge graphs; Knowledge graph; Algorithms; Neural Networks, Computer; data mining; Multi-modal; Alignment; nerve cell network; Data Mining; Factor knowledge graph; Factorization; female; Humans; knowledge; Knowledge; Matchings; mining; Multi-modal entity alignment; procedures; Triplet-aware GNN; #data-management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the construction of smart grid projects, there is a need for effective utilization of power knowledge. In this situation, knowledge graphs have been widely applied to various businesses in the power domain. However, there are a large number of synonymous entities in graphs of different business areas, which is not conducive to the integration of power knowledge and is a major obstacle to building a large-scale, generic power knowledge graph. Entity alignment is the process of identifying all entities in different graphs that point to the same object in the real world. Excellent entity alignment technology is essential for constructing a comprehensive, accurate, and high-quality knowledge graph in the power domain. In this paper, we propose an entity alignment method that integrating dual entity classification and graph attention networks. The method first categorizes the entities in the power knowledge graph into multiple sub-graphs based on their functional differences and the types of attribute values they contain. Using graph attention network frameworks on the sub-graphs formed by the dual entity classification, the model can capture the complex dependency relationships between entities and reasonably calculate the weights of each neighboring entity when aggregating entity features.

However, existing methods for wind power prediction have the following problems: 1) some studies aim at predicting wind power for a single wind farm, ignoring the correlations of the adjacent wind farms; 2) many studies tend to convert wind speed forecast results to wind power, increasing the conversion error; 3) almost all studies place emphasis on the capture of spatiotemporal features, neglecting the influence of spatiotemporal coupling. Therefore, to solve the above questions, this work proposes an adaptive graph neural network based on spatiotemporal attention calculation for short-term wind farm cluster power prediction, using only wind power data. Firstly, a dynamic undirected graph is established to sufficiently learn prior knowledge of spatial relationships. Next, the spatiotemporal coupling relationship and global temporal correlation between data can be computed by performing spatiotemporal cross-attention and temporal self-attention, respectively. Finally, a novel hybrid loss function is proposed to optimize the prediction model accurately. In a case study, compared with other benchmark methods, the proposed method shows excellent overall performance in predicting wind power. © 2013 IEEE.","2023","2024-06-26 09:43:27","2025-06-15 18:37:50","","131418-131434","","","11","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","3 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 2 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 2 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/LEKC5LI3/10325487.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/AZ38CHRS/Li et al. - 2023 - A Spatiotemporal Coupling Calculation-Based Short-.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/KCHFKBKV/Li et al. - 2023 - A Spatiotemporal Coupling Calculation-Based Short-.ocr.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/EPPURS66/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/4BC5AJ5A/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/NGZVUW5I/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/VNY4RC6F/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/FNA5MNFX/page-5.html","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10325487?arnumber=10325487; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/10005208/10325487.pdf?tp=&arnumber=10325487&isnumber=10005208&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9MTAzMjU0ODc=; notion://www.notion.so/Li-et-al-2023-16351901975e441aa0e66eed09a71676","#done; Graph neural networks; Features extraction; Predictive models; Wind power generation; Wind farm; notion; Weather forecasting; Electric utilities; Short-Term wind power predictions; Electric load dispatching; Real time systems; Benchmarking; Computational modelling; Spatiotemporal phenomenon; adaptive graph neural network; Adaptive graph neural network; attention calculation; Attention calculation; Short-term wind power prediction; spatiotemporal coupling; Spatiotemporal coupling; Undirected graphs; #forecasting","Computational modeling; Spatiotemporal phenomena; Data models; Feature extraction; Mathematical models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the development of large-scale wind power bases, wind power spatiotemporal correlations of multiple wind farms (WFs) can be used to improve short-term wind power prediction accuracy and efficiency. However, the time-varying and coupling characteristics of wind power spatiotemporal correlations present significant challenges for the accurate prediction of multi-WF power. In this paper, we propose an adaptive spatiotemporal fusion graph neural network for short-term power forecasting of multiple wind farms. Based on regional weather forecasts and historical wind power data, an adaptive directed graph is generated to model the dynamic spatial correlations between the WFs and the impact of regional weather factors on the wind power of different WFs. Graph convolution modules and temporal recursive modules are then alternately arranged to fuse the spatial and temporal features of wind power and to output the wind power prediction results for multiple WFs and time points. The case study results show that the proposed model outperforms the investigated baseline models in terms of prediction accuracy and that each model component has a unique contribution. © 2023 Author(s).","2023","2024-06-26 09:43:27","2025-11-26 09:22:49","","","","1","15","","J.

Therefore, this paper proposes a wideband oscillation disturbance source localization method based on LSTM variational autoencoder signal compression and graph convolutional neural network. This method encodes and compresses the measurement signals at the substation to adapt to the limited communication bandwidth. Then, the main station uses the compressed data, combined with system topology information, to locate the oscillation source through a graph convolutional neural network.

State-of-the-art smart power grid Missing Data Imputation (MDI) algorithms either operate on individual timeseries and are unable to capture spatial dependencies due to the power grid topology or they operate on the entire dataset, requiring complex models which lead to overfitting. In this work, we develop a novel technique to perform spatiotemporal missing data imputation. Using the power grid topology and timeseries data obtained from the metering infrastructure in the grid as input, we develop a Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network based Denoising Autoencoder (STGNN-DAE) that performs MDI by accounting for both temporal and spatial correlations. Using a real dataset obtained from a distribution test grid in Midwest, Iowa, we compare the proposed model with existing solutions for MDI. We show that our GNN based autoencoder obtains an improvement of 4.3% to 25.2% in error metrics such as Mean Absolute Error compared to the state-of-the-art missing data imputation methods. © 2021 Owner/Author.","2021","2024-07-31 11:06:16","2025-11-17 19:09:20","2021-06-28","458-465","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","","English","","","Scopus","","","","26 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 15 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 15 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] Journal Abbreviation: e-Energy - Proc.

To accomplish this, we present a method that uses graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn complex bus voltage estimates from PMU voltage and current measurements. We propose an original implementation of GNNs over the power system's factor graph to simplify the integration of various types and quantities of measurements on power system buses and branches. Furthermore, we augment the factor graph to improve the robustness of GNN predictions. This model is highly efficient and scalable, as its computational complexity is linear with respect to the number of nodes in the power system. Training and test examples were generated by randomly sampling sets of power system measurements and annotated with the exact solutions of linear SE with PMUs. The numerical results demonstrate that the GNN model provides an accurate approximation of the SE solutions. Furthermore, errors caused by PMU malfunctions or communication failures that would normally make the SE problem unobservable have a local effect and do not deteriorate the results in the rest of the power system. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2023","2024-06-26 09:43:27","2025-06-15 19:07:41","","","","","34","","Sustain.

Solar irradiance forecasting is becoming an effective way to support the power ramp rate control, mitigate power intermittency, and improve grid resilience. However, most previous research focuses on the predictor applied to the central PV farm but fails to fit the distributed PV system well. This article proposes a novel deep learning architecture, namely, group solar irradiance neural network, used for solar irradiance forecasting. The strategy adopts a convolutional graph neural network to mine distributed PVs' graphs and identify the critical features. Meanwhile, the scheme includes a long-short-term memory recurrent neural network to capture the temporal correlations. The proposed solution shows an improved universality for model training and results in accurate and reliable predictions compared to other solutions. Furthermore, the learning architecture can be applied to the master-slave deployment scheme to reduce overall system cost. The proposed algorithm is tested with the data sourced from the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The evaluation demonstrates the highest accuracy and best fitting for solar irradiance forecasting in comparison with other prediction methods. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","2022","2024-06-26 09:43:27","2025-06-15 19:45:54","","6142-6149","","9","18","","IEEE Trans.

In this study, a novel framework combining variational mode decomposition (VMD), graph neural network (GNN) and temporal forecasting component is proposed for wind speed forecasting using multiple atmospheric variables. VMD is employed to decompose atmospheric variables into distinct subsequences at various frequencies, and GNN is utilized to effectively pass, aggregate, and update variable features, thus enabling the extraction of pairwise dependencies among the different variables. Subsequently, the transformer model is used as the temporal forecasting component in the proposed framework. Compared with several state-of-the-art transformer-based models and baseline models in AI field, the superior performance of our hybrid framework is observed. Lastly, several other deep learning models, including multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU), are selected as forecasting component for assessing the applicability of the transformer. Interestingly, the transformer exhibits the lowest performance, while the GRU demonstrates the most promising results, with the mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.1356 m/s and 0.1085 m/s for one-step ahead forecasting, respectively. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into a novel framework and the applicability of the transformer for wind speed forecasting. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2024-01","2024-07-31 11:06:39","2025-11-26 09:22:28","","122155","","","353","","Applied Energy","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","17 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-11-26] 38 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 36 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/TAN8W33G/Jiang et al. - 2024 - Applicability analysis of transformer to wind spee.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/3U6PJA8F/Jiang et al. - 2024 - Applicability analysis of transformer to wind spee.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/IS7AHNAL/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/WFCGU38H/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/RQTKLLS8/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/ZNF5K6WG/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/XM33VREZ/page-5.html","","#done; Graph neural networks; Graph neural network; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Transformer; Wind speed; #Check; learning; Learning frameworks; Applicability analysis; atmospheric electricity; Atmospheric variables; Efficient managements; Electric power systems; Multiple atmospheric variable; Multiple atmospheric variables; Performance; power generation; Short-term forecasting; Variational mode decomposition; Wind speed forecasting; wind velocity; #forecasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Event-driven (ED) data packets are generated in the cyber layer in response to emergency conditions in the grid such as weather conditions, physical sabotage, cyber-attacks, etc. For proper management of the resources at the cyber layer, and hence, timely delivery of ED packets, efficient prediction of ED traffic conditions is required. Since the stochastic arrival process of ED packets is attributed to several factors, a data-driven prediction approach is appealing. However, this is challenged by: (a) unavailability of datasets capturing ED packet arrivals and departures at the cyber layer of the power grid, which are needed to train and test the data-driven models, (b) sparsity of the ED traffic data as emergency conditions are rare, and such sparsity impedes the learning process of data-driven models based on gradient descent, and (c) inability of traditional models, e.g., multilayer perceptron (MLP), long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to present accurate prediction as they fail to capture the interactions among the routers within the cyber layer. To address these challenges, this paper: (a) proposes a method to generate ED traffic based on real emergency reports in the U.S. power grid, (b) proposes a pre-processing method to convert the sparse ED traffic data into dense data, and (c) proposes a topology-aware prediction model based on graph neural network (GNN) to accurately predict the network condition. Our results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed GNN-based approach. © 2022 IEEE.","2022-10","2024-06-26 09:43:27","2025-11-26 09:22:29","2022-10-25","322-327","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","IEEE Xplore","","3 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-11-26] 2 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 2 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 2 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Int.

Two types of data and command packets are associated with such field devices, namely, periodic fixed scheduling (FS) and emergency-related event-driven (ED) packets, which require different levels of quality-of-service (QoS) support. However, existing routing strategies in smart power grids are not adaptive to network conditions and cannot guarantee differentiated QoS support. To overcome this limitation, we propose a software-defined network (SDN) proactive routing framework in smart grids that takes into account the current and future state of the network while making the routing decisions. The proposed framework offers the following features: (a) It sets up separate queues for ED and FS packets, with higher priority for the ED queue; (b) It predicts the future traffic condition at each switch within the network (congested or not congested) using a graph-neural-network (GNN) model that provides an accurate prediction of the traffic condition despite the sparsity of the ED events; (c) It adopts a reinforcement learning (RL) strategy that establishes an ideal route and updates the queue service rate for each switch along the route following the network's current and predicted future congestion condition. The proposed framework is tested on the cyber layers of the IEEE 14-bus and 39-bus test systems, and compared to two benchmarks. Our results indicate the superiority of our proposed framework compared with the benchmarks. © 2023 The Author(s)","2023","2024-06-26 09:43:27","2025-11-26 09:23:04","","","","","5","","e-Prime - Adv.

Researchers have long been interested in the classification problem of electric power anomaly detection. Anomaly detection can stop little issues from snowballing into unmanageable issues. In addition, it helps cut down on energy waste. Existing anomaly detection models mostly ignore the spatial attribute of electricity consumption data. They would primarily emphasize the time series information contained within the energy consumption data. Furthermore, the trace has the ability to precisely reconstruct consumer pathways; the smart grid can thus use it to detect anomalies. To fill this research gap, we propose a trace-based graph deep learning model to detect anomalous consumers in the smart grid. An unsupervised encoder–decoder is used in the proposed model. First, our model combines traces using an efficient unified graph representation and provides quality scores. Then, the long short-term memory network extracts the temporal attributes, while the graph neural network extracts the spatial attributes. Finally, it computes the anomaly score by adding two hyper-parameters with two-part loss values. We conducted experiments on power consumption data that was gathered from an open-source dataset. The proposed model performs better than a range of standard anomaly detection models. The F1-score of our model is 94.60%, and the AUC is 98.90%. Experiments show that our model is stable even in extreme data imbalance. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.","2024","2024-06-26 09:43:27","2025-11-17 19:11:14","","","","","","","Electr Eng","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","3 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/8ERHVTQA/Ida Evangeline et al. - 2024 - Anomaly detection in smart grid using a trace-base.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/YZ7FB3V4/Ida Evangeline et al. - 2024 - Anomaly detection in smart grid using a trace-base.ocr.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/PGX5CXFZ/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/BADWV65U/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/4TIXVZT3/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/GBXNFAUJ/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/FL87SB55/page-5.html","https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00202-024-02327-6.pdf; notion://www.notion.so/Ida-Evangeline-et-al-2024-7389a77e30214d49a0a0b83511c6dece","#done; Graph neural networks; Graph neural network; Smart grid; Deep learning; Anomaly detection; Energy-consumption; Learning systems; notion; Smart power grids; Electric power; Electric power utilization; Anomaly detection models; Learning models; Energy consumption; Energy wastes; Spatial attribute; Spatio-temporal learning; #faults-reliability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The underlying wind farms are modeled by an undirected graph, where each node corresponds to a wind site. For each node, temporal features are extracted using a long short-term memory Network. A scalable graph convolutional deep learning architecture (GCDLA), motivated by the localized ﬁrst-order approximation of spectral graph convolutions, leverages the extracted temporal features to forecast the wind-speed time series of the whole graph nodes. The proposed GCDLA captures spatial wind features as well as deep temporal features of the wind data at each wind site. To further improve the prediction accuracy and capture robust latent representations, the rough set theory is incorporated with the proposed graph deep network by introducing upper and lower bound parameter approximations in the model.

False data injection attack (FDIA) is one of the classes of those attacks that target the smart measurement devices by injecting malicious data. The employment of machine learning techniques in the detection and localization of FDIA is proven to provide effective results. Training of such models requires centralized processing of sensitive user data that may not be plausible in a practical scenario. By employing federated learning for the detection of FDIA attacks, it is possible to train a model for the detection and localization of the attacks while preserving the privacy of sensitive user data. However, federated learning introduces new problems such as the personalization of the detectors in each node. In this paper, we propose a federated learningbased scheme combined with a hybrid deep neural network architecture that exploits the local correlations between the connected power buses by employing graph neural networks as well as the temporal patterns in the data by using LSTM layers.

The trend suggests that the deployment of PV systems will continue to rise in the future. Thus, accurate forecasting of PV performance is critical for the reliability of PV systems. Due to the complex non-linear variability in power output of the PV systems, forecasting PV power is a non-trivial task. This variability affects the stability and planning of a power system network, and accurate forecasting of the performance of the PV system can reduce the uncertainty caused during PV operation. In this work, we leverage spatial and temporal coherence among the power plants for PV power forecasting. Our approach is motivated by the observation that power plants in a region undergo similar environmental exposure. Thus, one power plant’s performance can help improve the forecast of other power plants' power values in the region. We utilize the relationship between PV plants to build a spatiotemporal graph neural network (st-GNN) and train machine learning models to forecast the PV power. The computational experiments on large-scale data from a network of 316 systems show that spatiotemporal forecasting of PV power performs significantly better than a model that only applies temporal convolution to isolated systems or nodes. Furthermore, the longer the future forecast time, the difference between the spatiotemporal forecasting and the isolated system forecast when only temporal convolution is applied increases further.","2021-05-18","2024-06-26 09:43:27","2025-11-26 09:36:33","2024-04-18 16:37:07","15323-15330","","17","35","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2021 Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence","","","","ojs.aaai.org","","58 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-11-26] 44 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 37 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 30 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] Number: 17","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/WK9MA95P/Karimi et al. - 2021 - Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network for Performanc.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/YAW7HCVH/Karimi et al. - 2021 - Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network for Performanc.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/TRWS96QM/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/VYPSJWCR/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/HDDLRDVM/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/T235N753/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/QHLYHYIB/page-5.html","https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/17799/17606","#done; notion; #forecasting","Timeseries Forecasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, existing methods for solving power flow problems are computationally inefficient considering the many simulations needed to quantify uncertainties in system performance. This work presents a novel physics-informed graph attention-based method for power flow analysis in power transmission systems. We employ a graph attention network (GAT) based architecture which leverages the self-attention mechanism. As a result, structural information of a graph is learned and utilized to implicitly consider the importance of nodes in the graph. Through the integration of the GAT model, the power flow analysis is efficient and applicable to inductive learning problems where the model has to generalize to a priori unseen power grids. Furthermore, the physics-based knowledge of the power flow analysis is directly implemented by enforcing minimization of the violation of Kirchhoff’s law at each bus during training. To illustrate the performance of the proposed model, well-known IEEE power grid testbeds, namely, case9, case14, case30, and case118 are selected and the graph attentionbased model is tested and compared with state-of-the-art methods. The result of these analyses indicates the efficacy of the physics-informed graph attention-based approach in achieving a superior accuracy and less computational cost. Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed model to the variations in power grid topology is demonstrated.

Two distinct categories of control data packets exist within smart grids: fixed-scheduling (FS) and event-driven (ED). An intelligent routing strategy is required to satisfy latency requirements for FS and ED packets across various quality-of-service (QoS) levels and must be resilient to failures. Our proposed software-defined routing strategy balances requirements by dynamically adjusting decisions based on packet types. It prioritizes paths with lower latency and higher throughput for ED packets while prioritizing paths with higher redundancy and lower congestion for FS packets. This strategy switches between proactive and resilient modes based on network conditions. First, the proactive routing module (PRM) utilizes a graph neural network (GNN) and a Q-learning (QL) algorithm to fix sub-optimal routes for efficient packet delivery under normal conditions. Second, the resilient routing module (RRM) combines a deep Q-network with GNN to select optimal routes that remain viable even during failures, ensuring continued operation and robustness. Both modules update the queue service rate (QSR) using QL-agent while avoiding congestion. The GNN ensures proactive module selection based on excessive congestion violations indicating failure conditions. Given the efficient performance of the PRM in normal conditions and the resilience of the RRM under failures, the proposed strategy presents a dual-mode routing that minimizes overhead with a high level of resilience. The proposed approach, evaluated using the IEEE 39-bus test system cyber-layer, effectively ensures desired QoS routing regardless of the conditions of the cyber-layer.","2024","2024-10-01 18:22:24","2025-11-17 19:10:08","2024-10-01 18:22:24","111169-111186","","","12","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","2 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 2 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 2 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/X2PP5WB8/Islam et al. - 2024 - Software-Defined Networking-Based Resilient Proactive Routing in Smart Grids Using Graph Neural Netw.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/ZRQQZVSL/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/V35BMW3U/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/XE997W3Q/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/T5CQK6EU/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/YILM868E/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/VUXLJDKH/Islam et al. - 2024 - Software-Defined Networking-Based Resilient Proactive Routing in Smart Grids Using Graph Neural Netw.pdf; ","https://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx8/6287639/10380310/10623446.pdf?arnumber=10623446","#done; Graph neural networks; graph neural network; Smart grid; Predictive models; Reinforcement learning; Smart power grids; Deep neural networks; Load modeling; Smart grids; Software defined networking; Quality of service; Delay; data traffic prediction; deep Q-networks; resilient proactive routing; software-defined routing; Routing algorithms; Routings; Data traffic predictions; Deep Q-network; Proactive routing; Quality-of-service; Resilient proactive routing; Software-defined routing; Traffic control; #data-management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this requires that the energy used to meet the demand is green. To meet this requirement, accurate forecasting of the charging demand is vital. Short and long-term charging demand forecasting will allow for better optimisation of the power grid and future infrastructure expansions. In this paper, we propose to use publicly available data to forecast the electric vehicle charging demand. To model the complex spatial-temporal correlations between charging stations, we argue that Temporal Graph Convolution Models are the most suitable to capture the correlations.

To raise the accuracy of non-intrusive power load decomposition methods, a household power load decomposition model with factor hidden Markov model was established, which aims to use a message passing mechanism to improve the graph neural network and solve the power load decomposition model. The outcomes denote that the research design method can realize an F1 Score of 0.9326 and a mean absolute error of 10.24 in power load decomposition.

In this paper, a wide-area multiple bus loads forecasting model is proposed. First, take the rapid computation of the maximal information coefficient (Rap­ idMIC) value between bus loads as edge features, and combine the multiple node feature set to construct a similar-weighted spatial–temporal graph. The constructed similar-weighted spatial–temporal graph is not con­ strained by geography and grid topology, and can directly reflect the degree of spatial–temporal coupling cor­ relation between bus loads. Second, the neighboring node features of each node in the graph are extracted by the spatial convolution layer (SCL) to achieve full-domain node feature enhancement. Finally, the features extracted were formed into temporal series and input to the gated recurrent unit layer (GRUL) to achieve a wide-area multiple buses short-term load forecast. The research was carried out by selecting the measured load data (15 busbars). The corresponding symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are 3.19 % to 5.89 % and 1.83 megawatts (MW) to 9.8 MW, respectively. Compared with the SMAPE of other methods, the worst evaluation metrics in the test set are improved by 1.82 % to 5.94 %, and it has better robustness in the scene with abnormal load data.","2023-02-01","2024-06-26 09:43:27","2025-06-15 18:37:51","2024-05-16 08:12:49","108651","","","145","","International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","57 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 55 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 54 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/M2SY7PW5/Huang et al. - 2023 - Gated spatial-temporal graph neural network based .ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/FDKJ7E4Y/Huang et al. - 2023 - Gated spatial-temporal graph neural network based .pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/HYWH8HF9/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/6HVEN6VT/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/AEGWJIE5/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/22P86Y46/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/UWJIEY9V/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/TLS3XQXM/S0142061522006470.html; ","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142061522006470","#done; notion; #forecasting","Short-term load forecasting; Similar-weighted spatial–temporal graph; Spatial–temporal graph convolutional neural network; Wide-area multiple buses","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, a data-driven approach based on Graph Convolution Neural Networks (G-CNNs) is presented for SE in smart grids. The G-CNN can learn the features in the non-Euclidean domain of graphs, which can capture the structures and interactions among the components of power grids. By integrating the temporal dependencies in the time-series data, a temporal GCNN (T-GCN) is adopted for the SE problem. Speciﬁcally, a message-passing G-CNN is used to capture the topological structure of the smart grid and the gated recurrent units are used to capture the dynamic variation of state information for temporal dependencies.

The application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is particularly promising due to their ability to learn from graph-structured data present in power grids. Combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL), they can serve as control approaches to determine remedial grid actions. This review analyses the ability of Graph Reinforcement Learning (GRL) to capture the inherent graph structure of power grids to improve representation learning and decision making in different power grid use cases. It distinguishes between common problems in transmission and distribution grids and explores the synergy between RL and GNNs. In transmission grids, GRL typically addresses automated grid management and topology control, whereas on the distribution side, GRL concentrates more on voltage regulation. We analyzed the selected papers based on their graph structure and GNN model, the applied RL algorithm, and their overall contributions. Although GRL demonstrate adaptability in the face of unpredictable events and noisy or incomplete data, it primarily serves as a proof of concept at this stage. There are multiple open challenges and limitations that need to be addressed when considering the application of RL to real power grid operation.","2024-07-30","2024-08-13 14:14:55","2025-07-04 14:07:51","2024-08-13 14:14:55","","","","","","","Graph Reinforcement Learning in Power Grids","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","3 citations (Semantic Scholar/arXiv) [2025-04-09] arXiv:2407.04522 [cs]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/WAZAZJTR/Hassouna et al. - 2024 - Graph Reinforcement Learning in Power Grids A Sur.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/G24R7IZJ/Hassouna et al. - 2024 - Graph Reinforcement Learning in Power Grids A Sur.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/WIVQ38XM/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/DYK3FNXB/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/88EUU2IQ/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/BNSVH872/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/BDGUSWC7/page-5.html","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04522v1","#done; #ReviewIdeas; #survey","Computer Science - Machine Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2407.04522","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By representing the power grid as a line graph with branches as vertices, we can train a GNN that is accurate and robust to changes in topology. In addition, by using specialized GNN layers, we are able to build a very deep architecture that accounts for large neighborhoods on the graph, while implementing only localized operations. We perform three different experiments to evaluate: i) the beneﬁts of using localized rather than global operations and the tendency of deep GNN models to oversmooth the quantities on the nodes; ii) the resilience to perturbations in the graph topology; and iii) the capability to train the model simultaneously on multiple grid topologies and the consequential improvement in generalization to new, unseen grids.

Based on the measured power output and ”free-stream” (undisturbed) wind conditions, determined at an upstream WTG unaffected by wakes, a data-driven free-stream power curve model was built. The cluster of WTGs was then represented by a graph data structure in the form of an adjacency matrix, where the turbines are nodes, which in turn are connected by edges. The edges are represented by weightings, indicating the strength of wake interactions between connected turbines. To learn the weightings, the predicted power outputs of the free-stream power curve model were compared to the measured power outputs and then optimised to account for these differences, which are attributed to wake interaction losses. After that a new data-driven model was trained, with free-stream wind speed, direction and yaw misalignment as features and the optimised weightings as targets. It was shown that the model was able to predict power curves that show clear patterns due to wake effects and reduced the root mean squared error, based on the measured and predicted values, by 16.29% compared to the free-stream power curve model.","2023-05","2024-06-26 09:43:09","2025-06-15 18:37:51","2024-05-16 10:12:11","012047","","1","2505","","J.

It is crucial to consider voltage stability margin (VSM) as a constraint when modifying grid topology. However, it is nontrivial to exhaustively search using AC power ﬂow (ACPF) for all control actions with desired VSM. Sensitivity methods are used to solve this issue of ‘‘power ﬂow-free VSM estimation’’ to screen candidate control actions. However, due to the volatile nature of DERs, sensitivity methods do not perform well near nonlinear operating regions which is overcome by solving ACPF. Here, we propose a new VSM estimation method that performs well at nonlinear operating regions without solving ACPF. We achieve this by formulating the learning of graph neural networks like the matrix-free power ﬂow algorithms. We empirically demonstrate how this similarity bypasses the inaccuracy issues and performs well on unseen operating conditions and topologies without further re-training. The effectiveness is demonstrated on a power network with realistic load and generation proﬁles, various generation mix, and large control actions.

This problem is notorious for its signiﬁcant computational complexity, primarily attributable to its inherently nonlinear and nonconvex nature. Recently, there has been a growing interest in harnessing Graph Neural Networks (GNN) as a means to tackle this optimization task, leveraging the incorporation of grid topology within neural network models. Nonetheless, existing techniques fall short in accommodating the diverse array of components found in contemporary grid networks and restrict their scope to homogeneous graphs. Furthermore, the constraints imposed by the grid networks are often overlooked, resulting in suboptimal or even infeasible solutions. To address the generalization and effectiveness of existing end-to-end OPF learning solutions, we propose OPF-HGNN, a new graph neural network (GNN) architecture and training framework that leverages heterogeneous graph neural networks and incorporates the grid constraints in the node loss function using differentiable penalty regularization. We demonstrate that OPF-HGNN is robust and outperforms traditional GNN learning by two orders of magnitude traditional GNN learning across a large variety of real-world grid topologies and generalization settings.","2024-07-21","2024-11-14 14:53:07","2025-11-17 19:07:15","2024-11-14 14:53:07","1-5","","","","","","OPF-HGNN","","","","","IEEE","Seattle, WA, USA","en","https://doi.org/10.15223/policy-029","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","1 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 0 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/AWVP3VQ7/Ghamizi et al. - 2024 - OPF-HGNN Generalizable Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks for AC Optimal Power Flow.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/JT5GMX7Q/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/T9MU3X8J/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/IXICCJKM/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/3TFJW7RB/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/YGAIA7T9/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/QARDS6H7/Ghamizi et al. - 2024 - OPF-HGNN Generalizable Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks for AC Optimal Power Flow.pdf","","#done; Graph neural networks; Graph algorithms; Graph Neural Network; Electric load flow; Network theory (graphs); Smart power grids; Electric power transmission networks; Flow graphs; Heterogeneous graph; Grid topology; Robustness; OPF; Generalisation; Heterogeneous graph neural network; Heterogeneous GNN; Physics-Informed; Physic-informed; Grid network; #optimization-control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2024 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting (PESGM)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address this issue, data-driven approaches are proposed but they are not robust to the uncertain injections and varying topology. This article proposes a model-driven graph convolution neural network (MD-GCN) for power flow calculation with high-computational efficiency and good robustness to topology changes. Compared with the basic graph convolution neural network (GCN), the construction of MD-GCN considers the physical connection relationships among different nodes. This is achieved by embedding the linearized power flow model into the layer-wise propagation. Such a structure enhances the interpretability of the network forward propagation. To ensure that enough features are extracted in MD-GCN, a new input feature construction method with multiple neighborhood aggregations and a global pooling layer are developed. This allows us to integrate both global features and neighborhood features, yielding the complete features representation of the systemwide impacts on every single node. Numerical results on the IEEE 30-bus, 57-bus, 118-bus, and 1354-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed method achieves much better performance as compared to other approaches in the presence of uncertain power injections and system topology.","2024","2024-06-26 09:43:09","2025-11-25 13:58:06","2024-04-25 10:51:05","1-12","","","","","IEEE Trans.

Although promising results have been obtained, there lacks a systematic comparison between these architectures throughout literature. Accordingly, we introduce a concise framework for generalizing methods for machine learning assisted OPF and assess the performance of a variety of FCNN, CNN and GNN models for two fundamental approaches in this domain: regression (predicting optimal generator set-points) and classiﬁcation (predicting the active set of constraints). For several synthetic power grids with interconnected utilities, we show that locality properties between feature and target variables are scarce and subsequently demonstrate marginal utility of applying CNN and GNN architectures compared to FCNN for a ﬁxed grid topology.

When it comes to distribution networks, the problem is especially challenging due to the non-homogeneous characteristics and unique topology of each feeder. This paper presents a method based on gated graph neural network for automatic fault localization on distribution networks. The method aggregates problem data in a graph, where the feeder topology is represented by the graph links and nodes attributes can encapsulate any selected information such as operated devices, electrical characteristics and measurements at the point. The main advantage of the proposed solution is that it is immune to network reconfiguration and allows the use of a single trained model on multiple feeders. An experiment was conducted with faults simulated on 10 different feeders, all of them based on actual distribution feeders. The results shows that the model is able to generalize the correlations learned on training to correctly predict the fault region in most cases, even on a feeder it has not seen before.","2021-10-01","2024-06-26 09:43:09","2025-06-15 18:55:55","2024-04-18 15:34:37","2259-2266","","5","103","","Electr Eng","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","20 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 17 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 17 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/MTNNVCIF/de Freitas and Coelho - 2021 - Fault localization method for power distribution s.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/BNKSDFHN/de Freitas and Coelho - 2021 - Fault localization method for power distribution s.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/E879YBT4/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/C337KM73/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/YEQ8GEU6/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/LTSDG3BP/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/ZI2YXPHA/page-5.html","https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00202-021-01223-7.pdf","#done; Graph neural networks; Fault localization; Distribution networks; Topology; notion; Neural networks; Graph structures; Power distribution system; Fault location; Electric power systems; Graph neural network (GNN); Automatic fault localizations; Distribution feeders; Electrical characteristic; Feeding; Network re-configuration; Node prediction; Power systems operation; #faults-reliability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sparsity of low frequency total power data features, coupled with the model’s challenge in effectively extracting and utilizing spatial and temporal correlations in diverse load data, presents obstacles to achieving high precision disaggregation in nonintrusive load disaggregation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a disaggregation framework that integrates graph signal processing (GSP) with a convolutional neural network (CNN). In this framework, the GSP module tackles the issue of sparse load features, while the CNN disaggregation module extracts and exploits various features, such as spatial and temporal correlations between different loads. The GSP module directly provides load features to the CNN disaggregation module, assigning weights to the outputs for selection and thereby enhancing the accuracy of the disaggregation process.

Deep learning (DL) models can learn complex patterns in the data and have found wide success in predicting wake losses and expected power production. This paper proposes a modular framework for attention-based graph neural networks (GNN), where attention can be applied to any desired component of a graph block. The results show that the model significantly outperforms a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and a bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) model, while delivering performance on-par with a vanilla GNN model. Moreover, we argue that the proposed graph attention architecture can easily adapt to different applications by offering flexibility into the desired attention operations to be used, which might depend on the specific application. Through analysis of the attention weights, it was showed that employing attention-based GNNs can provide insights into what the models learn.

This paper introduces a novel method that combines the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm with data compression techniques to enhance feature selection and reduce redundancy in wind speed prediction. By employing GWO, essential features were identified by grouping the dataset into intervals and analyzing their frequencies. Performance evaluation was conducted using various compression measures, including Rate DC-Miss, Rate DC-MEF, and Rate DC-BDG, compared with other models such as extreme gradient boosting, space-time graph neural networks, and deep learning models. The study’s results show significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency for predicting wind speed compared to existing techniques. The proposed approach addresses both larger datasets and the impact of noise samples on prediction errors. Additionally, an MLDDR model was introduced to predict DC power generated from wind datasets, encompassing five stages: Data Preparation, Feature Selection, Data Compression, GRU-Based Predictions, and Rate of Reduction. Data reduction results are notable. The original wind dataset (104857613) was reduced to 1093913 after processing missing values, achieving a reduction rate of 0.136. Applying the MEF-GWO algorithm further reduced the dataset to 109395, with a reduction rate of 0.385. The BDG dataset was compressed to 1805, with a reduction rate of 0.607. In terms of prediction performance, the GRU model was evaluated on three datasets: the original, MEF, and BDG-GWO datasets. The GRU model demonstrated the highest accuracy (99.20 %) with the BDG-GWO dataset, with precision (0.9965), recall (0.9978), and F1 scores (0.9897) indicating superior performance. Training and testing times varied significantly, highlighting the computational challenges associated with deep learning techniques. This research addresses both programming and application challenges. Programming challenges include high computational demands and the trial-and-error nature of parameter determination in deep learning, mitigated by using GWO. Application challenges involve reducing large datasets, grouping them into intervals, and evaluating performance using different compression measures. The main research questions addressed include the suitability of the GWO algorithm for dataset reduction in terms of dimensions (features and records) and the effectiveness of combining GWO with deep learning, specifically GRU, for enhanced prediction results. The study concludes that the GWO-PCA and GRU combination significantly improves prediction accuracy and reduces implementation time.","2024-12","2025-04-04 13:18:08","2025-11-26 09:37:06","2025-04-04 13:18:08","102930","","","24","","Results in Engineering","Sustainable energy","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","24 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-11-26] 5 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 3 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/YG7TKILX/Al-Ibraheemi and Al-Janabi - 2024 - Sustainable energy Advancing wind power forecasting with grey wolf optimization and GRU models.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/R4WTZCLH/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/MGKNQYBK/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/DQ7IBRUS/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/GMYG7UVC/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/EBK6YXH4/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/GXPBH2QB/Al-Ibraheemi and Al-Janabi - 2024 - Sustainable energy Advancing wind power forecasting with grey wolf optimization and GRU models.pdf","","#done; #forecasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The solution is tested the in various topologies and its performance with the N-1 conditions and compared to some other power flow solutions in similar situations on IEEE 14-, 30-, and 118-bus test systems.","","2024-08-13 14:28:01","2025-06-15 20:06:42","2024-08-13 14:28:01","","","","","","","<P Class=""Els-Title"">Graph Neural Network for Power Flow Considering Line and Generator Contingencies<O","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/NKYWLS6C/Aboutalebi Zonouz and Tarafdar Hagh - Graph Neural Network for Powe.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/C3NN22PI/Aboutalebi Zonouz and Tarafdar Hagh - Graph Neural Network for Powe.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/943YTSE6/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/UWVNCY7I/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/BBZBAHE8/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/RMSYC882/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/AJWDFBR9/page-5.html","https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/e5852ef1-b11f-4045-ad10-449cf093cbf7-MECA.pdf?abstractid=4480802&mirid=1","#done; #optimization-control","Graph neural network; Power flow; N-1 Contingency; Node augmentation; Topology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4480802","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The electricity market is ruled by price regulation mechanisms that make it possible to adjust production to demand, as electricity is difficult to store. These mechanisms ensure the highest price for producers, the lowest price for consumers and a zero energy balance by setting day-ahead prices, i.e. prices for the next 24 h. Most studies have focused on learning increasingly sophisticated models to predict the next day’s 24 hourly prices for a given zone. However, the zones are interdependent and this last point has hitherto been largely underestimated. In the following, we show that estimating the energy cross-border transfer by solving an optimization problem and integrating it as input of a model improves the performance of the price forecasting for several zones together.","2023","2024-06-26 09:43:42","2025-11-25 21:16:13","","446-458","","","","","","Forecasting Electricity Prices","","","","","Springer Nature Switzerland","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","1 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 1 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 1 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/BTCQUP7I/Tschora et al. - 2023 - Forecasting Electricity Prices An Optimize Then P.pdf; ; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/KE4LBXKB/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/3SIY7RKZ/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/XPNB68Z6/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/KGCS7FBP/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/U5T3EFNT/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/VF3CSDUJ/Tschora et al. - 2023 - Forecasting Electricity Prices An Optimize Then P.ocr.pdf","https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-031-30047-9_35.pdf; notion://www.notion.so/Tschora-et-al-2023-2307b5008c2742d58a0c191f9033463d","#done; notion; #forecasting","Machine learning; Electricity Price Forecasting; Optimization-based data augmentation","Crémilleux, Bruno; Hess, Sibylle; Nijssen, Siegfried","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Knowledge graph plays an important role in recommendations and decision-making, while in the electric power industry there would be more possibilities for knowledge graph to be utilized. However, as a complex cause and effect network, the electric power domain knowledge graph has massive nodes, heterogeneous edges, and sparse structure, thus it requires human effort to process data, while the quality and the accuracy cannot be guaranteed. We propose a novel graph computing-based knowledge reasoning method that takes into account the sparsity of the electric power domain knowledge graph, to solve the above problems and achieve improved accuracy of graph classification and knowledge reasoning tasks. The Haar basis is constructed to realize fast calculation, while the multi-scale network structure is introduced to assure the classification accuracy and generalization. We ran simulations and analyzed the results on the NCI-1, CEPRI_UHVP, and CEPRI_EQUIP databases, and it demonstrated that our proposed algorithm showed an outstanding performance considering accuracy and loss.","","2024-06-26 09:43:42","2025-06-15 20:03:08","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/JV4WYLBS/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/EILCAW8X/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/VMLRLSYL/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/H7RQ8EMX/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/I8DHKCIH/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/6ZEG7JAA/Tianjiao et al. - Graph Computing Based Knowledge Reasoning in Elect.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/Q8EFT7QH/Tianjiao et al. - Graph Computing Based Knowledge Reasoning in Elect.pdf; ","notion://www.notion.so/Tianjiao-et-al-n-d-0ef952e163504a6aa05e6a9b114166a0; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/7054730/8661887/10322694.pdf?tp=&arnumber=10322694&isnumber=8661887&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL2Fic3RyYWN0L2RvY3VtZW50LzEwMzIyNjk0","#done; notion; #data-management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Predicting these dynamically changing states is essential for comprehending the underlying sensor and machine conditions. This understanding aids in detecting anomalies and faults, ensuring the reliable operation of the connected power grid, and in identifying faulty and miscalibrated sensors. PSH are complex, highly interconnected systems encompassing electrical and hydraulic subsystems, each characterized by their respective underlying networks that can individually be represented as graphs. To take advantage of this relational inductive bias, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been separately applied to state forecasting tasks in the individual subsystems, but without considering their interdependencies. In PSH, however, these subsystems depend on the same control input, making their operations highly interdependent and interconnected. Consequently, hydraulic and electrical sensor data should be fused across PSH subsystems to improve state forecasting accuracy. This approach has not been explored in GNN literature yet because many available PSH graphs are limited to their respective subsystem boundaries, which makes the method unsuitable to be applied directly. In this work, we introduce the application of spectral-temporal graph neural networks, which leverage self-attention mechanisms to concurrently capture and learn meaningful subsystem interdependencies and the dynamic patterns observed in electric and hydraulic sensors. Our method effectively fuses data from the PSH's subsystems by operating on a unified, system-wide graph, learned directly from the data, This approach leads to demonstrably improved state forecasting performance and enhanced generalizability.","2024-04-04","2024-08-13 14:18:06","2025-06-15 18:37:42","2024-08-13 14:18:06","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","1 citations (Semantic Scholar/arXiv) [2025-04-09] arXiv:2404.03368 [cs, eess]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/PSVT3XV4/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/2YC8AELJ/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/W6B5INXH/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/22Q23FYJ/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/7Y24QRYH/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/NHYVNQME/Theiler and Fink - 2024 - Graph Neural Networks for Electric and Hydraulic D.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/8XCENULD/Theiler and Fink - 2024 - Graph Neural Networks for Electric and Hydraulic D.pdf; ","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03368v1","#done; #forecasting","Computer Science - Machine Learning; Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Signal Processing; Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Systems and Control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2404.03368","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current prediction models predominantly concentrate on the temporal features of wind, neglecting or underutilizing the spatial interrelations among wind turbines, which results in suboptimal predictive performance. In response to this issue, we introduce a groundbreaking spatio-temporal model, GraphDeformer, which leverages signal decomposition for ultra-short-term wind power forecasting. GraphDeformer intricately assimilates an array of meteorological variables along with the geographical positioning of turbines as inputs. For the preprocessing of temporal meteorological data, GraphDeformer employs fast Fourier transform (FFT) to distill the periodic traits. The novel parallel architecture of GraphDeformer, comprising a graph neural network (GNN) and a Transformer, is deployed to meticulously harness the spatio-temporal dynamics. The performance of GraphDeformer is rigorously assessed by mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE). The outcomes reveal that, the integration of FFT significantly enhances the predictive accuracy of GraphDeformer. Moreover, in comparison to the state-of-the-art models, GraphDeformer shows superior performance in multi-step ultra-short-term prediction scenarios, underscoring its effectiveness in harnessing spatio-temporal attributes comprehensively, marking a notable advancement in wind power forecasting methodologies.","2024-03-06","2024-08-13 14:21:50","2025-06-15 18:37:42","2024-08-13 14:21:50","","","","","","","Graphdeformer","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 0 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/Q29CVT8M/Teng et al. - 2024 - Graphdeformer A Spatio-Temporal Model Integrating.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/PHFBJHQD/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/PPDBKI4B/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/T8N8H9KG/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/YMQSPU3X/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/FGDV6KWC/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/I2BZXDRA/Teng et al. - 2024 - Graphdeformer A Spatio-Temporal Model Integrating.ocr.pdf","https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/7de0c0ce-b627-499b-ae14-06d4443b94a5-MECA.pdf?abstractid=4750487&mirid=1","#done; #forecasting","Graph Neural Network; Fast Fourier Transform; Transformer; Wind power forecasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4750487","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing data-driven detectors aim to address simple traditional false data injection attacks (FDIAs). However, adversarial false data injection evasion attacks (FDIEAs) present a more serious threat as adversaries, with different levels of knowledge about the system, inject adversarial samples to circumvent the grid’s attack detection system. The robustness of state-of-the-art graph-based detectors has not been investigated against sophisticated FDIEAs. Hence, this paper answers three research questions: (a) What is the impact of utilizing spatio-temporal features to craft adversarial samples and how to select attack nodes? (b) How can adversaries generate surrogate spatio-temporal data when they lack knowledge about the system topology? (c) What are the required model characteristics for a robust detection against adversarial FDIEAs? To answer the questions, we examine the robustness of several detectors against five attack cases and conclude the following: (a) Attack generation with full knowledge using spatio-temporal features leads to 5 − 26% and 2 − 5% higher degradation in detection rate (DR) compared to traditional FDIAs and using temporal features, respectively, whereas centrality analysis-based attack node selection leads to 3 − 11% higher degradation in DR compared to a random selection; (b) Stochastic geometry-based graph generation to create surrogate adversarial topologies and samples leads to 3 − 13% higher degradation in DR compared to traditional FDIAs; (c) Adopting an unsupervised spatio-temporal graph autoencoder (STGAE)-based detector enhances the DR by 5 − 53% compared to benchmark detectors against FDIEAs.","2024-12","2024-12-13 17:18:00","2025-11-26 09:36:26","2024-12-13 17:18:00","6601-6616","","12","5","","IEEE Trans.

These uncertainties require consideration in power ﬂow analyses by calculating power ﬂow across a spectrum of generation and load values. Traditional power ﬂow methods, which rely on iterative solutions of non-linear equation sets, become computationally burdensome under these uncertain conditions. Surrogate models have been used to reduces the computational cost of power ﬂow analysis under uncertainty. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained increasing attention as surrogates for power system simulations. However, GNNs, similar to other machine learning models, require signiﬁcant amounts of training data. This paper proposes an innovative approach combining a multi-ﬁdelity methodology with a GNN-based surrogate model for eﬃcient power ﬂow calculations. This model is trained using both high-ﬁdelity power ﬂow simulations and low-ﬁdelity power ﬂow simulations. Our multi-ﬁdelity GNN model not only reduces the cost of generating training data, but also outperforms both single-ﬁdelity GNN models trained solely on high-ﬁdelity data and conventional neural network models. Additionally, the proposed model exhibits robustness to minor topology changes and achieves reasonable performance with unseen topologies.

We study how the inputs to the agent are processed through the layers of the neural network components. Additionally, we use these visualizations to indicate that the agent can learn general concepts of the power system, and we hypothesize that the method can be expected to scale well to larger power systems. We also explore how the agent behaves in a grid expansion scenario with a power system not experienced during training.","2024-12","2024-10-01 19:13:24","2025-11-26 09:38:32","2024-10-01 19:13:24","110717","","","237","","Electric Power Systems Research","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","2 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-11-26] 1 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 0 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/CL3V97E6/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/ZP6E5JIL/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/BID2IEX5/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/N7MIURJB/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/Y2MBDYSI/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/DHLCPM8V/Solheim et al. - 2024 - Visualizing graph neural networks in order to learn general concepts in power systems.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/AIPHCI3R/Solheim et al. - 2024 - Visualizing graph neural networks in order to learn general concepts in power systems.ocr.pdf","","#done; Graph neural networks; Power systems; Power; Neural-networks; Reinforcement learnings; Complex decision; Decision-making systems; Internal representation; Interpretability; Learn+; Power system; Reinforcement learning; Visualization; #data-management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These missing ﬂows depend both on the underlying physics (edge features and a ﬂow conservation law) as well as the observed edge ﬂows. This paper introduces an optimization framework for computing missing edge ﬂows and solves the problem using bilevel optimization and deep learning. More speciﬁcally, we learn regularizers that depend on edge features (e.g., number of lanes in a road, resistance of a power line) using neural networks.

Energy load data, inherently characterized as a multivariate time series, is influenced by various interdependent factors such as weather conditions, economic activity, and seasonal variations, all of which significantly impact the overall load dynamics. Though deep learning techniques, particularly with transformer-based models, have achieved significant progress in forecasting time series data, a gap exists in adequately acknowledging the importance of inter-series dependencies in multi-series load data. This paper proposes a novel graph-nested transformer model to effectively capture inter-series dependencies and forecast the load using a graph structure. The proposed Transformer model addresses two primary challenges: efficiently representing various temporal patterns and reducing redundant information within the series. In the proposed model, the graph neural network components are seamlessly integrated into the Transformer layers, allowing for the fusion of sequence encoding and graph aggregation in an iterative workflow. Evaluations across four distinct datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over state-of-the-art techniques in power load forecasting.","2024-07-13","2024-08-13 14:16:57","2025-06-15 18:37:43","2024-08-13 14:16:57","","","","","","","Smartformer","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 0 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/HC79GR8G/Saeed et al. - 2024 - Smartformer Graph-Based Transformer Model for Ene.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/6ACWWBLQ/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/HXUZSG96/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/Q4CR3VBI/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/KELIHVIS/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/XA3FULM3/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/RA8FXJ29/Saeed et al. - 2024 - Smartformer Graph-Based Transformer Model for Ene.ocr.pdf","https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/8955e02f-24b2-406f-b050-1e01bbb9442f-MECA.pdf?abstractid=4893923&mirid=1","#done; #forecasting","Graph Neural Network; Load Forecasting; Power Industry; Self- Attention; Smart Grid; Transformers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4893923","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using the spectral properties of the graph Laplacian, we show that we can express power ﬂows on the basis of Laplacian eigenvectors and reveal the dominant modes for nodal voltages and branch powers. The bus voltages are dominated by low rank modes. The power in the lines depends on the nodal distribution of generators/loads, the line impedances, and the gradient of the eigenvectors across the branches. The most loaded lines and their associated dominant mode are then identiﬁed.

The constraints and data associated with SCUC are both geographically and temporally correlated to ensure reliability of the solution, which further increases the complexity. In this article, an advanced machine learning (ML) model is used to study the patterns in power system historical data, which inherently considers both spatial and temporal (ST) correlations in constraints. The ST-correlated ML model is trained to understand spatial correlation by considering graph neural networks (GNN) whereas temporal sequences are studied using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The proposed approach is validated on several test systems namely, IEEE 24-Bus system, IEEE-73 Bus system, IEEE 118-Bus system, and synthetic South-Carolina (SC) 500-Bus system. Moreover, B-θ and power transfer distribution factor (PTDF) based SCUC formulations were considered in this research.

Existing GNN models that tackle MIP problems are mostly constructed from mathematical formulation, which is computationally expensive when dealing with large-scale UC problems. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed hierarchical graph convolutional network (PI-GCN) for neural diving that leverages the underlying features of various components of power systems to find highquality variable assignments. Furthermore, we adopt the MIP model-based graph convolutional network (MB-GCN) for neural branching to select the optimal variables for branching at each node of the B&B tree. Finally, we integrate neural diving and neural branching into a modern MIP solver to establish a novel neural MIP solver designed for large-scale UC problems. Numeral studies show that PI-GCN has better performance and scalability than the baseline MB-GCN on neural diving. Moreover, the neural MIP solver yields the lowest operational cost and outperforms a modern MIP solver for all testing days after combining it with our proposed neural diving model and the baseline neural branching model.","2023-11-26","2024-08-13 14:01:29","2025-11-26 09:35:51","2024-08-13 14:01:29","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","6 citations (Semantic Scholar/arXiv) [2025-11-26] 1 citations (Semantic Scholar/arXiv) [2025-04-09] arXiv:2311.15216 [cs, eess]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/B4S3PU9I/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/VQ44MCHH/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/52Z5F5P9/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/PBEUHSDH/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/2AL4MDRK/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/QA77K29V/Qin and Yu - 2023 - Solve Large-scale Unit Commitment Problems by Phys.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/EADAYQZ5/Qin and Yu - 2023 - Solve Large-scale Unit Commitment Problems by Phys.pdf; ","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.15216v1","#done; #optimization-control","Computer Science - Machine Learning; Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Systems and Control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2311.15216","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It presents RACLEARN that 1) uses a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based architecture to predict generator commitments and active line constraints, 2) associates a conﬁdence value to each commitment prediction, 3) selects a subset of the high-conﬁdence predictions, which are 4) repaired for feasibility, and 5) seeds a state-of-the-art optimization algorithm with feasible predictions and active constraints. Experimental results on exact RAC formulations used by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) and an actual transmission network (8965 transmission lines, 6708 buses, 1890 generators, and 6262 load units) show that the RACLEARN framework can speed up RAC optimization by factors ranging from 2 to 4 with negligible loss in solution quality.","2024-03","2024-06-26 09:43:42","2025-11-25 21:35:48","2024-05-02 14:05:11","3839-3850","","2","39","","IEEE Trans.

Specifically, we introduce a novel deep graph neural network called Moran’s I Based Deep Crossing Attention Dynamic Graph Neural Network (M-DCATDGN), which is designed for short-term load demand forecasting (STLF) tasks by robustly modeling spatio-temporal correlations and higher-order feature interactions. The architecture comprises three critical components: first, a learnable normalization block (FN-Block) that normalizes input signals to address distributional shifts during inference; second, the DCSE-Block, which is carefully designed to capture higher-order feature interactions, assigning differential importance to time steps to ensure the most relevant temporal features are leveraged in the forecasting process; and finally, the DFTS-Block, which utilizes multiple dynamic graph adjacency matrices guided by LMI to capture varying levels of spatial semantic information and enhance the training of adaptive adjacency matrices.

In its simplest form, OPF attempts to ﬁnd the optimal power that the generators within the grid have to produce to satisfy a given demand. Optimality is measured with respect to the cost that each generator incurs in producing this power. The OPF problem is non-convex due to the sinusoidal nature of electrical generation and thus is difﬁcult to solve. Using small angle approximations leads to a convex problem known as DC OPF, but this approximation is no longer valid when power grids are heavily loaded. Many approximate solutions have been since put forward, but these do not scale to large power networks. In this paper, we propose using graph neural networks (which are localized, scalable parametrizations of network data) trained under the imitation learning framework to approximate a given optimal solution. While the optimal solution is costly, it is only required to be computed for network states in the training set. During test time, the GNN adequately learns how to compute the OPF solution.

The growing integration of inverter-based distributed energy resources imposes strong influences on fault detection using traditional overcurrent relays. This paper utilizes emerging graph learning techniques to build new temporal recurrent graph neural network models for fault diagnostics. The temporal recurrent graph neural network structures can extract the spatial-temporal features from data of voltage measurement units installed at the critical buses. From these features, fault event detection, fault type/phase classification, and fault location are performed. Compared with previous works, the proposed temporal recurrent graph neural networks provide a better generalization for fault diagnostics. Moreover, the proposed scheme retrieves the voltage signals instead of current signals so that there is no need to install relays at all lines of the distribution system. Therefore, the proposed scheme is generalizable and not limited by the number of relays installed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is comprehensively evaluated on the Potsdam microgrid and IEEE 123-node system in comparison with other neural network structures.","2023","2024-06-26 09:43:42","2025-11-26 09:36:05","2024-04-18 14:34:12","46039-46050","","","11","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","43 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-11-26] 22 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 25 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 25 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/4SNWJYDE/Nguyen et al. - 2023 - Spatial-Temporal Recurrent Graph Neural Networks f.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/S5B29UZF/Nguyen et al. - 2023 - Spatial-Temporal Recurrent Graph Neural Networks f.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/GP2V4YVT/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/FJZUF5WS/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/PIHJCYVX/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/Q9FUNPCM/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/YHWUMVSR/page-5.html","notion://www.notion.so/Nguyen-et-al-2023-5bc24c71980740aa8de4c7a7dbc176e7","#done; #faults-reliability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To do so, we generate two synthetic datasets for grids with 20 and 100 nodes respectively and estimate SNBS using Monte-Carlo sampling. Those datasets are used to train and evaluate the performance of eight different GNN-models. All models use the full graph without simplifications as input and predict SNBS in a nodal-regression-setup.

For networked dynamical systems, structure is typically quantified with network measures. A functional property that is of theoretical and practical interest for oscillatory systems is the stability of synchrony to localized perturbations. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been shown to predict this stability successfully; at the same time, network measures have struggled to paint a clear picture. Here we collect 46 relevant network measures and find that no small subset can reliably predict stability. The performance of GNNs can only be matched by combining all network measures and nodewise machine learning. However, unlike GNNs, this approach fails to extrapolate from network ensembles to several real power grid topologies. This suggests that correlations of network measures and function may be misleading, and that GNNs capture the causal relationship between structure and stability substantially better.","2024-02-27","2024-08-13 14:19:47","2025-11-25 20:33:10","2024-08-13 14:19:47","","","","","","","Predicting Instability in Complex Oscillator Networks","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","1 citations (Semantic Scholar/arXiv) [2025-04-09] arXiv:2402.17500 [nlin]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/JTSL822B/Nauck et al. - 2024 - Predicting Instability in Complex Oscillator Netwo.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/4WPAYC2V/Nauck et al. - 2024 - Predicting Instability in Complex Oscillator Netwo.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/EJAHTPVM/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/CC9SG5ZH/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/NFCX89MB/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/7AESEAP9/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/WLCZGHWL/page-5.html","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17500v1","#done; #faults-reliability","Computer Science - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Social and Information Networks; Nonlinear Sciences - Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2402.17500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The emphasis stems from the ability of ML to overcome difficulties associated with model-based approaches, such as handling of nonGaussian measurement noise. However, topology changes pose a stiff challenge for performing ML-based SE because the training and test environments become different when such changes occur. This paper circumvents this challenge by formulating a graph neural network (GNN)-based time-synchronized state estimator that considers the physical connections of the power system during the training itself. The results obtained using the IEEE 118-bus system indicate that the GNN-based state estimator outperforms both the model-based linear state estimator and a data-driven deep neural network-based state estimator in the presence of non-Gaussian measurement noise and topology changes, respectively.","2023-10-15","2024-06-26 09:43:27","2025-11-26 09:37:25","2024-04-18 15:13:56","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","Asheville, NC, USA","en","https://doi.org/10.15223/policy-029","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","6 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-11-26] 3 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 0 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/KSAXZVWY/Moshtagh et al. - 2023 - Time-Synchronized State Estimation Using Graph Neu.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/G2MPV75H/Moshtagh et al. - 2023 - Time-Synchronized State Estimation Using Graph Neu.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/GIT2QY47/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/WK52ABRB/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/7QEI32EQ/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/HMDF8W8T/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/VQMF2XEC/page-5.html","notion://www.notion.so/Moshtagh-et-al-2023-c3c1fbbcdbb24cfdb14615c19f742594","#done; notion; #grid-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023 North American Power Symposium (NAPS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consequently, identifying critical nodes within the power grid holds immense significance. However, prior research either focuses on a single node metric or subjectively assigns weights to multiply metrics, resulting in inaccurate ranking lists. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces the CGA algorithm to identify critical nodes in the power grid using deep learning methods. Specifically, CGA employs the contraction algorithm to establish feature matrices and utilizes the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model to generate labels for nodes. Subsequently, CGA leverages the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to encode node information, effectively reducing computational complexity, then applies the Graph Neural Network (GNN) with an attention mechanism to learn node hidden representation. In addition, this paper employs two evaluation metrics to assess the effectiveness and distinguishability of CGA, including Kendall's tau correlation coefficient and monotonicity index. Through conducting extensive experiments on the three datasets, simulation results demonstrate that CGA performs better than the six baseline algorithms, in which the effectiveness of identifying critical nodes is improved and the distinguishability of the ranking list is enhanced. © 2024 SPIE.","2024-05-13","2024-07-17 23:29:34","2025-11-17 19:15:31","","1984-1991","","","13159","","","","","","","","SPIE","Wuhan, China","en","","","Scopus","","www.spiedigitallibrary.org","","0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 0 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/DTF2H3Z5/Zhang et al. - 2024 - Identifying critical nodes in the power grid via d.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/ITSEKJZJ/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/MJ67LWBJ/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/W25QXFRG/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/AM9D8B6X/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/WXSFPP85/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/4BENXGHX/display.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/QY9UKZ7P/Zhang et al. - 2024 - Identifying critical nodes in the power grid via d.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/CLEEMCXT/Zhang et al. - 2024 - Identifying critical nodes in the power grid via d.pdf","https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/13159/131597U/Identifying-critical-nodes-in-the-power-grid-via-deep-learning/10.1117/12.3024227.pdf; https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85194154663&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=eff7de4262adf439131132c6ae086283&sot=b&sdt=b&s=%28TITLE-ABS-KEY-AUTH%28%22Graph+Neural+Networks%22+AND+%22Power+Grid%22%29%29+AND+ORIG-LOAD-DATE+AFT+1717109441+AND+ORIG-LOAD-DATE+BEF+1717714244++AND+PUBYEAR+AFT+2022&sl=152&sessionSearchId=eff7de4262adf439131132c6ae086283&relpos=1","#done; Convolutional neural networks; Power grids; Graph neural networks; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Attention mechanisms; Learning systems; Complex networks; Attention Mechanism; CNN; GNN; Learning methods; Complex large power grid; Critical node; Large power; Distinguishability; Ranking lists; #faults-reliability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Eighth International Conference on Energy System, Electricity, and Power (ESEP 2023)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because of its complexity and high-quality requirements, substation equipment failure is inevitable. However, the existing fault prediction methods are mostly based on traditional methods, which have shortcomings in accuracy and reliability. The application of machine learning technology to fault prediction of substation equipment can greatly improve its reliability and security. Based on this, the random walk graph sampling algorithm is firstly adopted in this paper to form multiple batches of sub-graphs in the way of random walk, so as to solve the training complexity problem of large-scale equipment structures and improve the generalization of model training. On this basis, the classification algorithm based on stochastic graph convolution sampling neural network (GT-GCNN) is proposed. By aggregating the features of higher-order nodes, the semantic correlation information between long-distance graph nodes is fused, the overall perception ability of graph structure database is improved by multi-batch subgraph training, and the effectiveness of GT-GCNN algorithm in Inductive Learning scenario is verified in five public databases.","2024","2025-04-04 13:14:49","2025-11-25 14:02:53","","597-607","","","","","","","","","","","Springer Nature","Singapore","en","","","","","Springer Link","","0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/XAPBUQG4/Luo - 2024 - Fault Prediction and Classification of Large-Scale Substation Equipment Based on Neural Network.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/RK9HUTEX/Luo - 2024 - Fault Prediction and Classification of Large-Scale Substation Equipment Based on Neural Network.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/55HN47BJ/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/CP8UWI2S/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/RE4TH6LZ/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/KVDSE9J7/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/I4ZSGBJS/page-5.html","https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-981-97-3210-4_49.pdf","#done; #faults-reliability","Neural networks; Random walks; Substation equipment","Nakamatsu, Kazumi; Patnaik, Srikanta; Kountcheva, Roumiana","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High computational cost is the main obstacle for a more frequent online cascading failure search, which is essential to improve system security. In this work, we show that the complex mechanism of cascading failures can be well captured by training a graph convolutional network (GCN) ofﬂine. Subsequently, the search of cascading failures can be signiﬁcantly accelerated with the aid of the trained GCN model. We link the power network topology with the structure of the GCN, yielding a smaller parameter space to learn the complex mechanism. We further enable the interpretability of the GCN model by a layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) algorithm. The proposed method is tested on both the IEEE RTS-79 test system and China’s Henan Province power system. The results show that the GCN guided method can not only accelerate the search of cascading failures, but also reveal the reasons for predicting the potential cascading failures.","2020-01-30","2024-06-26 09:43:27","2025-06-15 20:11:36","2024-05-16 08:18:20","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","16 citations (Semantic Scholar/arXiv) [2025-04-09] arXiv:2001.11553 [cs, eess]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/YIGQ5LEG/Liu et al. - 2020 - Guiding Cascading Failure Search with Interpretabl.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/CNTQVZB3/2001.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/UBETAYCD/Liu et al. - 2020 - Guiding Cascading Failure Search with Interpretabl.ocr.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/BA4BMGV4/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/X6TX4P87/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/V5MNLXNM/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/ZD7YNF7I/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/NDA9MQUM/page-5.html","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.11553.pdf; https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11553; notion://www.notion.so/Liu-et-al-2020-8b5acf47108b43ddb517f2befa98f1fb","#done; notion; #faults-reliability","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Signal Processing; Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Systems and Control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2001.11553","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, there is a need for scalable algorithms that can provide accurate and fast solutions for both small and large scale power networks. As the power network can be interpreted as a graph, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for improving the accuracy and speed of PF approximations by exploiting information sharing via the underlying graph structure. In this study, we introduce PowerFlowNet, a novel GNN architecture for PF approximation that showcases similar performance with the traditional Newton–Raphson method but achieves it 4 times faster in the IEEE 14-bus system and 48 times faster in the realistic case of the French high voltage network (6470rte). Meanwhile, it significantly outperforms other traditional approximation methods, such as the DC power flow, in terms of performance and execution time; therefore, making PowerFlowNet a highly promising solution for real-world PF analysis. Furthermore, we verify the efficacy of our approach by conducting an in-depth experimental evaluation, thoroughly examining the performance, scalability, interpretability, and architectural dependability of PowerFlowNet.

Facing with the never-been-seen explosion of graph-structured data, the state-of-the-art deep learning technique-Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), becomes the leading trend in machine learning within just recent five years and demonstrated surprisingly broad and prominent benefits covering from new drug discovery to better IC design. However, its promising applications in Power Electronics are still rarely discussed and its full potential remains unexplored. Addressing this gap, this review paper is the first to outline GNNs’ general workflow in power electronics, laying the groundwork and examining current GNN methodologies within the field. To bridge the gap in the sparse GNN literature within this domain, we also provide extended discussions on leveraging insights from GNN-aided circuit design to enrich power electronics research. Our work includes in-depth GNN-based case studies that demonstrate promising applications from converters to system-level power electronics, showcasing GNNs’ unique benefits and untapped possibilities (e.g., accurate component design, voltage predictions on IEEE-13 bus and 118 bus systems). Additionally, we provide a comprehensive survey of GNNs’ latest and successful applications, emphasizing their impact on energy-centric sectors, such as transportation electrification, smart grids. Considering the interdisciplinary nature of power electronics in modern energy systems, our review highlights the potential of GNNs emerge as a promising tool to decode the intricate behavior and dynamics of power electronics systems, and we hope such synergies between advanced AI methodologies like GNNs with the ever-evolving graph theory can lead to more powerful tools, novel methodologies, and advancements in the power electronics community.","2023","2024-06-26 09:43:27","2025-11-17 19:11:26","2024-04-25 08:44:16","145067-145084","","","11","","IEEE Access","From Graph Theory to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","8 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 12 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 11 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/8NKCI3QR/Li et al. - 2023 - From Graph Theory to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/UN4DSZJM/Li et al. - 2023 - From Graph Theory to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/J2FZCQZF/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/4DYYSQ2A/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/33T6PVTL/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/HEBW9GJT/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/EUBF4V83/page-5.html","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/10005208/10368010.pdf?tp=&arnumber=10368010&isnumber=10005208&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL2Fic3RyYWN0L2RvY3VtZW50LzEwMzY4MDEw","#done; Power; Neural-networks; Smart grid; Deep learning; Power system; Graph theory; machine learning; Machine-learning; Smart power grids; smart grids; Neural networks; deep learning; Power systems reliability; Electric potential; Artificial intelligence; E-learning; Reliability theory; Energy systems; power systems; energy systems; Power electronics; Power-electronics; graph theory; neural network; Circuit theory; electronics automation design; graph intelligent design; Graph intelligent design; Integrated circuit manufacture; Intelligent designs; power electronics; Systematic; #survey","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, existing methods either suffer from the data privacy issue and the susceptibility to cyberattacks or fail to consider the spatial correlation among different stations. To address these challenges, a federated graph learning approach involving multiple charging stations is proposed to collaboratively train a more generalized deep learning model for demand forecasting while capturing spatial correlations among various stations and enhancing robustness against potential attacks. Firstly, for better model performance, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model is leveraged to characterize the geographic correlation among different charging stations in a federated manner. Secondly, to ensure robustness and deal with the data heterogeneity in a federated setting, a message passing that utilizes a global attention mechanism to aggregate personalized models for each client is proposed. Thirdly, by concerning cyberattacks, a special credit-based function is designed to mitigate potential threats from malicious clients or unwanted attacks. Extensive experiments on a public EV charging dataset are conducted using various deep learning techniques and federated learning methods to demonstrate the prediction accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach.","2024-04-30","2024-08-13 14:16:13","2025-11-25 21:44:20","2024-08-13 14:16:13","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","0 citations (Semantic Scholar/arXiv) [2025-04-09] arXiv:2405.00742 [cs, stat]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/6IYUH3GC/Li et al. - 2024 - Federated Graph Learning for EV Charging Demand Fo.pdf; ","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.00742v1","#done; #forecasting","Computer Science - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Cryptography and Security; Statistics - Machine Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2405.00742","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, data loss stemming from information attacks and other transmission failures diminishes the value of power data. Research on missing data recovery in transmission network nodes overlooks the stochastic characteristics of missing positions and random missing scales in missing information completion. Therefore, this paper proposes a graph convolution method with a location mask. This model introduces an input‒output matrix containing all node feature information to address random missing positions. The designed location mask and the class residual network structure formed by the graph convolution layers enhance the model's information mining and generalization capabilities, effectively addressing random missing positions and random missing scales. Subsequently, through comparison with other models and through testing across 61 scenarios involving various missing patterns and scales, the model's effectiveness and superiority are validated. Finally, a series of experiments are conducted to explore the role of the location mask during the data recovery task.","2024-02-13","2024-08-13 14:01:01","2025-06-15 20:20:18","2024-08-13 14:01:01","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","In Review","","0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 0 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/S3XBRGQ8/Li et al. - 2024 - Missing Data Recovery for Transmission Networks Us.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/QR2ZG735/Li et al. - 2024 - Missing Data Recovery for Transmission Networks Us.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/VQUWQMAE/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/LH5IF8CB/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/CPHIBDUC/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/XTWK3BXJ/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/GR8XD5R3/page-5.html","https://assets-eu.researchsquare.com/files/rs-3947828/v1_covered_75d95e38-661e-4767-9dc7-8ef5210f60dd.pdf?c=1715280144","#done; #data-management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PMUs, being cyber-physical devices, are susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as false data injection (FDI). As FDI can lead to incorrect state estimation and subsequent destructive impacts, the prompt detection of falsified data is crucial to preclude such adverse outcomes. In response to this challenge, this paper introduces a spatial-temporal graph neural network (ST-GNN) for the detection and localization of anomalies in the PMU network. The model incorporates a convolutional neural network and long short-term memory units, which are adept at extracting spatial and temporal features effectively. The inclusion of graph-based analysis in our model significantly improves the understanding of interconnections between neighboring PMUs, thereby enhancing its precision in detecting and pinpointing anomalies, even under sophisticated stealth false data injection attacks. The performance of this framework has been thoroughly evaluated on two IEEE test systems, the 39-bus and 127-bus systems, across a variety of attack scenarios.

In general, obtaining an optimal solution to such problems is computationally infeasible even in small settings, so heuristic algorithms are often used to find near-optimal solutions. In order to attain the right assignment permutation, this study investigates a general-purpose learning strategy that uses a bipartite graph to describe the problem structure and a message passing Graph Neural Network (GNN) model to learn the correct mapping. Comparing the proposed structure with two existing DNN solutions, simulation results show that the proposed approach significantly improves classification accuracy, proving to be very e±cient in terms of processing time and memory requirements, due to its inherent parameter sharing capability. Among the many practical uses that require solving allocation problems in everyday scenarios, we decided to apply the proposed approach to address the scheduling of electric smart meters access within an electricity distribution smart grid infrastructure, since near-real-time energy monitoring is a key element of the green transition that has become increasingly important in recent times. The results obtained show that the proposed graph-based solver, although sub-optimal, exhibits the highest scalability, compared with other state-of-the-art heuristic approaches.

However, these methods are highly sensitive to data corruption, and as the scale of the power grid continues to expand, the model’s solving accuracy deteriorates. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces a multi-scale graph attention network (UMGAN) that leverages the spatial structural characteristics of the power grid. In order to enable the model to fully exploit the correlations between power grid branches and learn more precise node feature representations, we have designed a simplified graph neural network convolution kernel, creating a lighter U-shaped structure for multi-scale sampling of power grid data. Additionally, an attention layer has been incorporated at skip connections to reduce the impact of data corruption. Furthermore, for the multi-task learning module, we have devised a multi-task loss function tailored for power grid parameter identification tasks. This loss function effectively balances multiple objectives, allowing simultaneous identification of multiple parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that the multi-scale graph attention network proposed in this paper outperforms other machine learning and deep learning methods, providing more accurate predictions of power grid branch parameters.","2024-07-11","2024-07-31 11:17:45","2025-11-26 08:18:48","2024-07-31 11:17:45","1397-1410","","2","107","","Electr Eng","UMGAN","","","","","","","en","","","Scopus","","Springer Link","","0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 0 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/45J8I89B/Zou et al. - 2024 - UMGAN multi-scale graph attention network for gri.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/X9Y3VZFG/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/9EVGR2DL/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/CC532ZE3/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/HZIR2QKC/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/LE2UBH8T/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/JJJVJI7I/Zou et al. - 2024 - UMGAN multi-scale graph attention network for gri.ocr.pdf","https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00202-024-02589-0.pdf","#done; Power grids; Graph neural networks; Deep learning; Attention mechanism; Attention mechanisms; Convolution; Learning systems; Electric power transmission networks; Crime; Electric power transmission; Parameter estimation; Parameters identification; Multi-scales; Learning methods; Data corruption; Multi-scale graph convolution; Parameter identification; Shaped structures; U-shaped; U-shaped structure; #grid-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The manageable prediction of integrated energy systems plays a crucial role in adjusting the energy input structure in a reverse manner, leading to a substantial reduction in energy system waste and unnecessary expenses. Moreover, precise energy load forecasting can greatly enhance energy conservation efforts, facilitating environmental protection and promoting efficient resource utilization. The purpose of multi time series prediction usually involves learning time step features of multi-dimensional time series, followed by forecasting a time series over a period. However, traditional methods of extracting time series do not yield the same segmentation effect as a sentence, making it challenging to capture semantic information. Therefore, extracting local information is crucial for analyzing their relationships. A method has been proposed to aggregate time steps into subsequences called patch to enhance locality and extract semantic information that cannot be obtained at the point level, then put the semantic sub-series into the structure of a Fast Fourier Transform Graph Neural Network to learn the features in space and time dimensions. The proposed method demonstrates superior prediction accuracy compared to CNN, MLP, LSTM, RNN, GNN, StemGNN, MTGNN with great results: a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.251%, an explained variance score of 99.256%, and an R2-score of 99.138%.","2024","2025-04-04 12:31:09","2025-11-25 14:02:42","","303-315","","","","","","","","","","","Springer Nature","Singapore","en","","","","","Springer Link","","0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07]","","; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/YIYRSDGE/Zhao et al. - 2024 - Multivariate Time Series Forecasting of Integrated Energy Systems Based on Fast Fourier Transform Fu.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/CA4YGENL/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/BHY7X6NW/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/98V34RZW/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/N3JV9GGJ/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/QJIRR2FW/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/QRHZ7JRW/Zhao et al. - 2024 - Multivariate Time Series Forecasting of Integrated Energy Systems Based on Fast Fourier Transform Fu.ocr.pdf","https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-981-97-9674-8_22.pdf","#done; Graph neural networks; Fast Fourier Transform; Times series; Energy; Time step; Integrated energy systems; Patch; Space-Time Graph Neural Network; Spacetime; Resource allocation; Fast fourier; Fast Fourier transforms; Semantics Information; Space-time graph neural network; #forecasting","","Yu, Haipeng; Cai, Chengtao; Huang, Lan; Jing, Weipeng; Chen, Xuebin; Song, Xianhua; Lu, Zeguang","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional numerical methods for transient analysis not only are computationally intensive but also require precise contingency information as input, and therefore, are not suitable for online applications. Existing online transient assessment studies focus on the determination of post-contingency system stability or stability margin. This paper develops a novel graph-learning framework, Deep-learning Neural Representation or DNR, for online prediction, of the time-series trajectories of the system states using initial system responses that can be measured by phasor measurement units (PMUs). The proposed DNR framework consists of two sequential modules: a Network Constructor that captures network dependencies among generators, and a Dynamics Predictor that predicts the system trajectories. The key to improved prediction performance is the introduction of the spatio-temporal message-passing operations into graph neural networks with structural knowledge. Its effectiveness and scalability are validated through comparative studies, demonstrating the prediction performance under different contingency scenarios for systems of different sizes. This framework provides a solution to online predicting post-fault system dynamics based on real-time PMU measurements. Additionally, it can also be applied to facilitate the ofﬂine transient simulation without simulating the entire trajectories.","2022-11","2024-06-26 09:43:56","2025-11-25 20:33:43","2024-05-16 10:04:30","4885-4895","","6","37","","IEEE Trans.

The GNNs are trained using supervised learning, to predict the power grid’s aggregated bus-level (either zonal or system-level) or individual branch-level state under different power supply and demand conditions. The variability of the stochastic grid variables (wind/solar generation and load demand), and their statistical correlations, are rigorously considered while generating the inputs for the training data. The outputs in the training data, obtained by solving numerous mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) optimal power flow problems, correspond to systemlevel, zonal and transmission line-level quantities of interest (QoIs). The QoIs predicted by the GNNs are used to conduct hours-ahead, sampling-based reliability and risk assessment w.r.t. zonal and system-level (load shedding) as well as branch-level (overloading) failure events. The proposed methodology is demonstrated for three synthetic grids with sizes ranging from 118 to 2848 buses. Our results demonstrate that GNNs are capable of providing fast and accurate prediction of QoIs and can be good proxies for computationally expensive MILP algorithms.

MC simulation necessitates solving a large number of DC OPF problems corresponding to the samples of stochastic grid variables (power demand and renewable generation), which is computationally prohibitive. Computationally inexpensive surrogates of OPF provide an attractive alternative for expedited MC simulation. Graph neural network (GNN) surrogates of DC OPF, which are especially suitable to graphstructured data, are employed in this work. Previously developed DC OPF surrogate models have focused on accurate operational decision-making and not on risk quantification. Here, risk quantification-specific aspects of DC OPF surrogate evaluation is the main focus. To this end, the proposed GNN surrogates are evaluated using realistic joint probability distributions, quantification of their risk estimation accuracy, and investigation of their generalizability. Four synthetic grids (Case118, Case300, Case1354pegase, and Case2848rte) are used for surrogate model performance evaluation. It is shown that the GNN surrogates are sufficiently accurate for predicting the (bus-level, branch-level and system-level) grid state and enable fast as well as accurate operational risk quantification for power grids. The article thus develops tools for fast reliability and risk quantification in realworld power grids using GNN-based surrogates.","2024-04-21","2024-08-13 14:23:34","2025-11-23 14:20:28","2024-08-13 14:23:34","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","0 citations (Semantic Scholar/arXiv) [2025-04-09] arXiv:2311.03661 [cs, eess]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/7K2BPK2J/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/Y5FWZQ6H/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/FL9USPAP/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/B7RF4PVN/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/3I7LZBRZ/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/3BKXHAP3/Zhang et al. - 2024 - Operational risk quantification of power grids usi.ocr.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/IXNUA3MG/Zhang et al. - 2024 - Operational risk quantification of power grids usi.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.03661v2","#done; #faults-reliability","Computer Science - Machine Learning; Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Systems and Control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2311.03661","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Different models such as statistical models, machine learning and deep learning have been developed to investigate load forecasting. Due to the high uncertainty of the RES, these models suffer various problems such as low forecasting accuracy. Transformer is a novel neural network model based on self-attention mechanism, and its ability to effectively capture correlation between long sequences can be well applied to load forecasting. In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer model for electricity net load forecasting, which is termed as the TransformGraph. The TransformGraph combines the Transformer and graph convolutional network (GCN). Firstly, the proposed model uses the GCN to build an input embedding module that encodes the multivariate input sequence and aggregates multivariate correlation information. Then, the self-attention mechanism in Transformer is used to capture the temporal dependence of the sequence data. Finally, the predicted load values are output using a feed forward neural network. Furthermore, the data from three country in the Open Power System Data (OPSD) datasets are applied for case study. The comparisons are conducted between the proposed model and other five forecasting models, and results showed that the proposed model has higher forecasting accuracy and better stability.","2022-08-17","2024-08-13 14:02:02","2025-06-15 18:37:52","2024-08-13 14:02:02","","","","","","","Transformgraph","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","31 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 0 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/S98KR63Q/Zhang et al. - 2022 - Transformgraph A Novel Short-Term Electricity Net.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/LVHHJ257/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/XI4R6KBJ/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/TFVUF3BD/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/WM3A64P4/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/WYQN2LNE/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/JF47AL3H/Zhang et al. - 2022 - Transformgraph A Novel Short-Term Electricity Net.ocr.pdf","https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/bf9d9f6a-f846-4199-98aa-67c1be4e8452-MECA.pdf?abstractid=4192411&mirid=1","#done; #forecasting","transformer; graph convolutional network; Deep Learning; time series; electric load forecasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4192411","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The graph-based architecture of PIDGeuN provides a natural representation of the microgrid topology. Using only the state information that is practically measurable, PIDGeuN employs a time delay embedding formulation to fully reproduce the system dynamics, avoiding the dependency of conventional methods on internal dynamic states such as controllers. Based on a judiciously designed message passing mechanism, the PIDGeuN incorporates two physicsinformed techniques to improve its prediction performance, including a physics-data-infusion approach to determining the inter-dependencies between buses, and a loss term to respect the known physical law of the power system, i.e., the Kirchhoff’s law, to ensure the feasibility of the model prediction. Extensive tests show that PIDGeuN can provide accurate and robust prediction of transient dynamics for nonlinear microgrids over a long-term time period.

Our main idea is to systematically determine the GNN architecture by inspect- ing how the leading term of the Mori-Zwanzig memory term depends on the coarse-grained interaction coefficients that encode the graph topology. Based on this analysis, we found that the appropriate GNN architecture that will account for K-hop dynamical interactions has to employ a Message Passing (MP) mechanism with at least 2K steps. We also deduce that the memory length required for an accurate closure model decreases as a function of the interaction strength under the assumption that the interaction strength exhibits a power law that decays as a function of the hop distance. Supporting numerical demonstrations on two examples, a heterogeneous Kuramoto oscillator model and a power system, suggest that the proposed GNN architecture can predict the coarse- grained dy- namics under fixed and time-varying graph topologies.","2024-06-27","2024-08-13 14:35:03","2025-11-18 09:38:26","2024-08-13 14:35:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 0 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/GVWTV6GE/Yu et al. - 2024 - Learning Coarse-Grained Dynamics on Graph.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/HR27G6XH/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/ABCLNLFM/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/Z5BL9CDQ/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/AK6BAEES/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/7XMTCYIF/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/WQPJVFTU/Yu et al. - 2024 - Learning Coarse-Grained Dynamics on Graph.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/U9X3FUEF/Yu et al. - 2024 - Learning Coarse-Grained Dynamics on Graph.ocr.pdf","https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/5554c3fe-4c61-4b4d-a2a3-66fa719b0829-MECA.pdf?abstractid=4878937&mirid=1","#done; #methodology","graph neural network; coarse-graining; networked dynamics; non-Markovian modeling; time-varying topology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4878937","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The EnGAT-BiLSTM model aims to improve the prediction accuracy of the load and solve the sampled data sparsity in the short-term prediction. In this model, the Box-Cox transformation technology is used to denoise and obtain the effective load sampled data set; a dynamic load knowledge graph (DLKG) is designed to map the internal attribute of the various electrical load and the correlation of the external influencing factors; the graphic attention mechanism is introduced in the local network structure of graph neural network (GNN) to extract the high-quality load spatio-temporal features; the deep bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) framework is used for the lifelong learning of the load prediction.

A three-branch network structure is then designed to match the structure of LMPs' compositions. Such kind of network can extract the spatial-temporal features of LMPs, and provide fast and high-quality predictions for all nodes simultaneously.

However, traditional AI only learns from experiences in data and is unable to satisfy physical constraints. This may result in an un­ desired infeasible inference for PPF. To solve this issue, a physics-guided graph neural network (PG-GNN)-based PPF analysis method is proposed. At the outset, alternating current power flow equation is analyzed to produce gradients for connecting physical component and AI. The proposed PG-GNN then incorporates the sensitivities into the training tensor graph such that it enables in-depth physical learning. At the same time, the GNN serves to enhance generalizability in varying topology. The well-trained PG-GNN is finally leveraged to surrogate tradi­ tional power flow solver in Monte-Carlo method, such that real-time PPF is realized. Numerical tests on benchmarks demonstrate that, in unseen scenarios, the proposed method enables only little gap versus the exact baseline, but beats other rivals with over tenfold computing efficiency.

However, deep learning methods usually suffers from two limitations: (1) The power grid topology structure data belongs to non-Euclidean data, so the traditional deep learning methods can’t deal with this data, and it is easy to introduce noise. (2) The order of magnitude difference of different identi­ fication targets is too large, and it is easy to ignore small targets if they are identified at the same time, which makes the identification accuracy decline. To overcome these limitations, a novel multi-scale folded attention graph convolution network (MFAGCN) is proposed, which uses U-block to sample data from multiple scales in the power grid, and not only fuses the global nodes in the power grid system, but also avoids over-fitting caused by too deep layers of the graph convolution network. In addition, a new loss function is designed for the multitask module NestedTask-Block, which can balance the parameters of large targets and small targets, and realize multi-branch and multi-parameter simultaneous identification. The experimental results show that MFAGCN can achieve excellent performance through compared with the most advanced identification method.","2022-06-01","2024-06-26 09:43:56","2025-11-25 21:11:06","2024-05-16 09:52:41","107855","","","207","","Electric Power Systems Research","MFAGCN","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","21 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 23 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 23 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/MCK9IGEC/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/TQFNUX7C/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/982UX67G/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/K8R4QYN2/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/Z7H3B9PF/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/5HKEX76T/S0378779622000852.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/LVJBMVSL/Xia et al. - 2022 - MFAGCN A new framework for identifying power grid.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/3W7GDG8K/Xia et al. - 2022 - MFAGCN A new framework for identifying power grid.pdf","notion://www.notion.so/Xia-et-al-2022-8c42e03d74da406eb295ba5b418eb87a; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378779622000852?via%3Dihub","#done; Power grids; Graph neural networks; Graph neural network; Deep learning; Convolution; Electric power transmission networks; Multilevels; Electric power transmission; Parameter estimation; Parameters identification; Multi-scales; Learning methods; Parameter identification; Gated attention network; Multi-level information; Small targets; #grid-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the advent of computer big data technologies has ushered in fresh remedies for addressing fault prediction within intelligent power grids. Thus, leveraging big data, this paper introduces a power grid fault detection and early warning communication framework grounded on graph neural network models. This model can predict faults in the power grid, automatically calculate the most likely affected areas in the future, and timely collect communication to avoid large-scale ships with power grid faults.

As for enhancing the designs, challenges have arisen for designing a robust system due to the increasing scale of modern systems and the complicated underlying physical constraints. To tackle these challenges and design a resilient system efficiently, this study presents a generative design method that utilizes graph learning algorithms. The generative design framework contains a performance estimator and a candidate design generator. The generator can intelligently mine good properties from existing systems and output new designs that meet predefined performance criteria.

Recently, the graph neural network (GNN) has been applied in STLF and achieved impressive success via utilizing spatial dependency between residential households to improve STLF. However, GNN based forecasting models require a large amount of training data to learn reliable forecasting models. For a newly built residential neighbourhood, the historical electric load data might be insufﬁcient for the training of GNNs. Meanwhile, we can learn GNN based models on other areas, referred to as the source domains, with abundant data. In this paper, we propose to reuse the knowledge learned on the source domains to assist the model learning for an area that only a limited amount of data is available, referred to as the target domain.

Specifically, we design an adaptive graph learning layer that learns the spatial correlations in a data-driven manner. Additionally, an embedding project layer is integrated to enhance the graph learning layer. Subsequently, a graph recurrent layer consisting graph convolutional kernel and gated recurrent unit is employed to extract spatial-temporal features from the observations. We evaluate the proposed ASTGRN model using a real-world EV GPS trajectory dataset containing charging information of over 76,000 EVs in Beijing. The experiment results suggest that ASTGRN achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to those advanced spatial-temporal prediction models (e.g., Temporal Graph Convolutional Network and GraphWave Net). The effectiveness of the proposed model in charging demand prediction indicates that the spatial correlation between different charging stations may not be related to geographical distance in the charging demand prediction task, and the use of prior knowledge of geographical location may undermine model performance.","2024-03-06","2024-08-13 14:05:40","2025-06-15 18:37:42","2024-08-13 14:05:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 0 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/7BGDRGLJ/Wang et al. - 2024 - An Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Recurrent Networ.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/GQ7P46M2/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/GF3BBX66/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/CVFKP9IW/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/8A4VKB5P/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/9FCAWXFG/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/WQ5FRAJQ/Wang et al. - 2024 - An Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Recurrent Networ.ocr.pdf","https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/a69fb323-9ba9-48ef-a842-40ed33118d95-MECA.pdf?abstractid=4750430&mirid=1","#done; #forecasting","Graph convolutional neural network; Electric vehicles; Charging Demand Prediction; Gated Recurrent Unit.; Spatial-Temporal Graph Recurrent Network","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4750430","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The existing artificial intelligence stability analysis methods rely on a large number of fault case data, while the graph neural network method ignores the correlation characteristics of nodes themselves and the correlation of long-distance nodes. In order to solve the problems, the graph multi-attention neural network (GMANN) was proposed. The selfattention, which characterizes the correlation between different state quantities of a single node, is proposed, firstly. Then, long-distance association attention, which represents the correlation of distant nodes in the power grid, was proposed. The long-distance correlation attention and the adjacent correlation attention in graph attention network are fused to form a global attention that reflects the global importance of the power grid. The channel attention that characterizes the importance of different pooling methods of graph convolutional network is extracted and used to obtain the importance of different convolution operations. Finally, based on the multisource attention fusion strategy, global attention and channel attention are embedded in the graph attention neural network to form a multi-level evaluation model to achieve power grid stability evaluation efficiently guided by multiple attentions. The proposed GMANN is verified based on simulated fault cases obtained from the 10-machine 39-node system in New England.

This article proposes a data-driven method for the complex nonlinear mapping from probability distributions of renewable energy to those of critical section power (called distributions-in-distributions-out) with higher computational efficiency and accuracy. Compared with the existing data-driven probabilistic power flow methods where machine learning is used for power flow solution, a larger number of probability distributions are considered in the proposed method by constructing probability distributions as features. The proposed graph convolutional network (GCN) framework is proved better than long short-term memory (LSTM) network, deep belief network (DBN) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) in terms of adaptability to topology changes.

This study adopts a risk-informed approach to TEP, formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem that concurrently minimizes systemic risks and expansion costs. Given the intractability of this problem with conventional solvers, we turn to artificial intelligence techniques. In particular, we conceptualize power grids as graphs and introduce a goal-oriented graph generation methodology using deep reinforcement learning. We extend welfare-Q learning, a modified variant of Q-learning tailored to yield high rewards across multiple dimensions, by incorporating geometric deep learning for function approximation. This allows us to account for system security while minimizing grid expansion costs. Notably, system risk is evaluated by incorporating a Graph Neural Network (GNN) cascading failure meta-model into the proposed approach. The TEP method is applied to the IEEE 118-bus system, and the efficacy of this novel technique is compared against the state of the art. We conclude that the deep reinforcement learning method can compete with established methods for multi-objective optimization, identifying expansion strategies that improve system security at reduced costs. Furthermore, we test the robustness of the meta-model against topology changes in the transmission network, demonstrating its applicability to novel grid configurations.","2024-11-04","2025-04-04 10:17:06","2025-11-25 14:02:49","2025-04-04 10:17:06","","","","","","","","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/AHWW7UGM/Varbella et al. - 2024 - Goal-Oriented Graph Generation for Transmission Expansion Planning.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/2ZMEN5UR/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/CL483I94/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/XLQ3IFGS/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/FBCQX4XJ/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/G5RUTT5I/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/WRHVTV4Z/Varbella et al. - 2024 - Goal-Oriented Graph Generation for Transmission Expansion Planning.ocr.pdf","https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/ce387a66-461e-4f82-9a98-850e6bd1b9b5-MECA.pdf?abstractid=5008897&mirid=1","#done; #optimization-control","Deep reinforcement learning; multi-objective optimization; Transmission Expansion Planning; Power grid; Cascading Failures; Graph representation learning.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5008897","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ongoing energy transition poses new challenges for the decision-makers and system operators. Therefore, we must develop grid analysis algorithms to ensure reliable operations. These key tools include power flow analysis and system security analysis, both needed for effective operational and strategic planning. The literature review shows a growing trend of machine learning (ML) models that perform these analyses effectively. In particular, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) stand out in such applications because of the graph-based structure of power grids. However, there is a lack of publicly available graph datasets for training and benchmarking ML models in electrical power grid applications. First, we present PowerGraph, which comprises GNN-tailored datasets for i) power flows, ii) optimal power flows, and iii) cascading failure analyses of power grids. Second, we provide ground-truth explanations for the cascading failure analysis. Finally, we perform a complete benchmarking of GNN methods for node-level and graph-level tasks and explainability. Overall, PowerGraph is a multifaceted GNN dataset for diverse tasks that includes power flow and fault scenarios with real-world explanations, providing a valuable resource for developing improved GNN models for node-level, graph-level tasks and explainability methods in power system modeling.

Traditional frequency-constrained unit commitment models simplify the average system frequency and neglect the spatial characteristics of frequency dynamics, potentially underestimating the risk of contingencies. In this paper, we consider a nodal frequency response model to capture the frequency dynamics in the unit commitment problem. Nodal frequency dynamics and RoCoF expressions are converted into security constraints against worst contingency, which are then incorporated into the proposed muti-region frequency-constrained unit commitment (MR-FCUC) formulations. To improve the efficiency and performance of the MR-FCUC model, a decomposition algorithm is implemented to solve the MR-FCUC efficiently. The subproblem of the original model confirms the frequency dynamics, and sensitivity cuts are refined based on the validation errors. Additionally, a GNN-based voltage phase angle predictor is incorporated to boost the computational efficiency of the FCUC model. A case study involving modified IEEE 24-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed GNN-MR-FCUC model.

Therefore, we propose a recommendation method for power knowledge retrieval based on a graph neural network (RPKR-GNN). The method first uses a graph neural network to learn the network structure information of the power fault knowledge graph and realize the deep semantic embedding of power entities and relations. After this, it fuses the power knowledge graph paths to mine the potential power entity relationships and completes the power fault knowledge graph through knowledge inference. At the same time, we combine the user retrieval behavior features for knowledge aggregation to form a personal subgraph, and we analyze the user retrieval subgraph by matching the similarity of retrieval keyword features. Finally, we form a fusion subgraph based on the subgraph topology and reorder the entities of the subgraph to generate a recommendation list for the target users for the prediction of user retrieval intention. Through experimental comparison with various classical models, the results show that the models have a certain generalization ability in knowledge inference. The method performs well in terms of the MR and Hit@10 indexes on each dataset, and the F1 value can reach 87.3 in the retrieval recommendation effect, which effectively enhances the automated operation and maintenance capability of the power system. © 2023 by the authors.","2023","2024-06-26 09:43:09","2025-11-26 09:34:14","","","","18","12","","Electronics (Switzerland)","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","3 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-11-26] 1 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 1 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 1 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/D62F84TK/Hou et al. - 2023 - Recommendation Method of Power Knowledge Retrieval.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/JAZFACBV/Hou et al. - 2023 - Recommendation Method of Power Knowledge Retrieval.ocr.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/R2SX5KFE/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/D4I52TCI/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/XAHM5PHZ/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/INAWCHET/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/9KV55ZB2/page-5.html","https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/12/18/3922/pdf?version=1695016899; notion://www.notion.so/Hou-et-al-2023-6e136b76f6d940ffb33b65f78d1de2d5","#done; graph neural network; notion; knowledge inference; recommender system; search intent prediction; #data-management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most of the current work of WPF only capture temporal correlation in the time domain but ignore the spatial correlation. In this study, a spectral time graph neural network based on the maximum correlation criterion (MCC-Stem-GNN) is proposed to improve the accuracy of WPF for multiple sites and horizons. The self-attentive mechanism in the MCC-Stem-GNN automatically learns the correlations between the multivariate sequences. Besides, this model combines the Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) to model spatial correlation and the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to model temporal correlation. The effectiveness of the proposed robust deep learning framework is verified on the simulated wind energy dataset over 16 locations in Ohio, US through considering different sample contamination types and levels, comprehensive case study is carried out to show the superiority of the MCC-Stem-GNN over the benchmarks. © 2022 The Authors.

The diversified operation modes of power system put forward higher requirements for real-time and topology generalization of transient stability assessment. Based on Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT), this paper uses the wide-area transient response features to evaluate the transient angle stability and voltage stability of power system. Firstly, CNN is used to encode the temporal variation characteristics of transient features of electrical components in hidden layer space. Secondly, the encoded hidden layer features are mapped into graph data samples according to the spatial topological correlation of electrical components, so as to train and build a multi-task transient stability assessment model based on GAT. The model can adaptively capture the interaction relationship between encoded hidden layer features of topologically correlated components, and realizes real-time evaluation of transient angle stability and transient voltage stability by perceiving the temporal–spatial correlation of transient features. Finally, Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method is used to explain the decision-making mechanism of the model and extract the key features that affect the transient stability, so as to enhance the ability of power grid operators to perceive the transient stability situation. The results of IEEE-39 system show that the transient stability assessment model has good accuracy and topology generalization, and the results of interpretable analysis are in line with the conclusions of traditional mechanism cognition, which helps to improve the credibility of the model results. © 2023 The Author(s)","2023-10","2024-06-26 09:43:09","2025-11-25 20:48:46","","930-942","","","9","","Energy Reports","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","8 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 9 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 9 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/VXJX9C2F/Gu et al. - 2023 - Multi-task transient stability assessment of power.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/IBTPUL59/Gu et al. - 2023 - Multi-task transient stability assessment of power.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/VDZ5NCPQ/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/2LVAQLQB/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/57SVM5DU/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/CKJLWVMD/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/6HK8TUZH/page-5.html","notion://www.notion.so/Gu-et-al-2023-7af62f1bbd1a44edae1f3b75797d31e9","#done; Graph neural networks; Power; Graph neural network; Deep learning; Topology; notion; Decision making; Electric power system stability; Transient stability assessment; Transient analysis; Wide area networks; Multi tasks; Generalisation; Angle stability; Additives; Shapley additive explanation; Deep learning interpretable method; Hidden layers; Shapley; #faults-reliability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional simulation-based methods for grid resilience analysis suffer from computational complexity and limited ability to capture the full spectrum of potential disruptions. This paper presents a novel approach to enhance grid resilience by leveraging transductive graph neural network (GNN) learning to identify critical nodes and links. By leveraging the graph structure and system features, GNNs effectively learn resilience metrics and accurately identify critical nodes based on actual grid operational behavior. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through case studies on node criticality scoring and critical node/line identification in cascading outage scenarios. The results highlight the advantages of learning-based methods over traditional simulation-based approaches and their potential to revolutionize grid resilience analysis.

As deep learning advances, graph neural networks (GNNs) have great potential to capture spatial dependencies in ocean meteorology. However, existing GNN models usually use predefined or learned static graphs. They lack the ability to model dynamic spatial associations, which can limit the performance of GNNs. In this paper, we propose a dynamic adaptive spatio-temporal graph neural network (DASTGN) that uses dynamic graph convolution (DGCN) to capture dynamic spatial dependencies in offshore wind speed data. Based on the assumption that not only long-term static associations but also short-term dynamic associations exist in the spatial domain and that the importance of these two associations is different, we propose a dynamic adaptive graph generation module to generate static and dynamic graphs to model these two associations. Meanwhile, a matrix fusion mechanism is proposed to fuse them into the optimal dynamic graph, which is fed into the DGCN module. We employ a temporal convolution module to capture the nonlinear temporal dependencies. Finally, the above modules are integrated into a dedicated spatio-temporal convolution module to predict wind speed. Extensive experiments on real wind speed datasets in Chinese seas showed that the DASTGN improved the performance of the optimal baseline model by 3.05% and 3.69% in terms of the MAE and RMSE, respectively. To demonstrate that the DASTGN can effectively model dynamic spatial associations, the generated graph structure is visualized and analyzed. Finally, we present policy implications aimed at enhancing the security of the power system. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","2023-07","2024-06-26 09:43:09","2025-06-15 18:37:51","","110294","","","141","","Applied Soft Computing","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","17 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 13 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 13 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/HT4RHTPH/Gao et al. - 2023 - Dynamic adaptive spatio-temporal graph neural netw.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/ZUJI278M/Gao et al. - 2023 - Dynamic adaptive spatio-temporal graph neural netw.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/YJ9Y6PGE/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/4JW448ZZ/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/QH3H3MEI/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/MQZP6NIX/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/Z8KHJ7AU/page-5.html","notion://www.notion.so/Gao-et-al-2023-68e8f9c4bdb5414b95d4d9e0cdfee4e0","#done; Graph neural networks; Deep learning; Forecasting; Convolution; notion; Spatio-temporal graphs; Wind speed; Dynamic-adaptive; Spatial dependencies; Wind speed forecasting; Dynamic graph; Dynamic graph convolution; Dynamic spatial; Dynamic spatial dependencies; Dynamic spatial dependency; Offshore oil well production; #forecasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The huge variation of the power system infrastructure in recent years has led to significant changes in the consumers’ consumption pattern. Therefore, short-term load forecasting (STLF) is transformed to a more complicated problem in recent years. To address this issue, this paper proposes a graph-based deep neural network to capture full spatial-temporal features and be able to oversee high volatility time series including load sequence. The proposed spatial deep learning structure benefits from learning the spatial feature using Gabor filter-oriented layers and full understanding the temporal behaviour based on bidirectional networks. The designed learning-based system is developed as a graph-based learning system to improve the accuracy considering the meteorological information behaviour. To verify the performance of the designed deep graph network, the actual load data of Shiraz, Iran, is used. Besides, to demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed, the designed deep graph network is compared with three well-known shallow and deep networks in different cases including yearly performance, seasonal performance, and sensitivity analysis on the meteorological data. © 2022 The Authors.

It is the foundation of probabilistic prediction and even a slight increase in the prediction accuracy can exert significant improvement for the safe and economic operation of power systems. However, due to the complex spatiotemporal relationship and the intrinsic characteristic of nonlinear, randomness and intermittence, the prediction of regional wind farm clusters and each wind farm’s power is still a challenge. In this paper, a framework based on graph neural network and numerical weather prediction (NWP) is proposed for the ultra-short-term wind power prediction. First, the adjacent matrix of wind farms, which are regarded as the vertexes of a graph, is defined based on geographical distance. Second, two graph neural networks are designed to extract the spatiotemporal feature of historical wind power and NWP information separately. Then, these features are fused based on multi-modal learning. Third, to enhance the efficiency of prediction method, a multi-task learning method is adopted to extract the common feature of the regional wind farm cluster and it can output the prediction of each wind farm at the same time. The cases of a wind farm cluster located in Northeast China verified that the accuracy of a regional wind farm cluster power prediction is improved, and the time consumption increases slowly when the number of wind farms grows. The results indicate that this method has great potential to be used in large-scale wind farm clusters. © 2020, MDPI AG.

With the increasing prevalence of electric vehicles (EVs), power system attacks that can lower customers charging satisfaction rates are on the rise. The existing false data injection attacks (FDIAs) detection strategies are not suitable for protecting the power-dependent transportation infrastructure since (a) these detectors are primarily optimized for power grids alone, and (b) they overlook the impact of attacks on the quality-of-service of EVs and charging stations (CSs). In response to these challenges, this paper aims to develop an FDIA detection strategy that takes advantage of the data correlations between power and transportation systems, ultimately enhancing the charging satisfaction rate. To achieve this goal, we propose a graph autoencoder-based FDIA detection scheme capable of extracting spatio-temporal features from both power and transportation data. The input features of power systems are active and reactive power while those for transportation systems are the hourly traffic volume in CSs. The proposed model undergoes comprehensive training and testing on various types of FDIAs, showcasing improved generalization abilities. Simulations are conducted on the 2,000-bus power grid of the state of Texas, featuring 360 active CSs. Our investigations reveal an average detection rate of 98.3%, representing a substantial improvement of 15-25% compared to state-of-the-art detectors. This underscores the effectiveness of our proposed approach in addressing the unique challenges posed by power-dependent electrified transportation systems.

Several approaches exist that tackle this problem by exploiting modern deep learning tools. However, most previous works focus on predicting the total load as a univariate time series forecasting task, ignoring all fine-grained information captured by the smart meters distributed across the power grid. We introduce a methodology to account for this information in the graph neural network framework. In particular, we consider spatio-temporal graphs where each node is associated with the aggregate load of a cluster of smart meters, and a global graph-level attribute indicates the total load on the grid. We propose two novel spatio-temporal graph neural network models to process this representation and take advantage of both the finer-grained information and the relationships existing between the different clusters of meters. We compare these models on a widely used, openly available, benchmark against a competitive baseline which only accounts for the total load profile. Within these settings, we show that the proposed methodology improves forecasting accuracy. © 2022 IEEE.","2022","2024-06-26 09:43:09","2025-11-17 19:06:53","2022-07-18","","","","2022-July","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","5 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 3 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 3 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] Journal Abbreviation: Proc Int Jt Conf Neural Networks","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/W8S7PGVA/Eandi et al. - 2022 - Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Aggregat.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/WCGV5HL2/Eandi et al. - 2022 - Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Aggregat.pdf; ; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/VRBD6N9W/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/YV4IWDVM/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/CPYZJZ24/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/JAX5KZW6/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/N7X3LX8U/page-5.html","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9892780&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL2RvY3VtZW50Lzk4OTI3ODA=; notion://www.notion.so/Eandi-et-al-2022-bc9c9946c0b84321b28427a56e7d4d1e","#done; Graph neural networks; Smart grid; Deep learning; Load forecasting; Electric power plant loads; Smart Grid; notion; Smart power grids; Electric power transmission networks; Smart meters; Spatio-temporal graphs; Electric load forecasting; Electric Load Forecasting; Electricity demands; Aggregate load; Aggregates; Core components; Fine grained; Spatio- temporal graph neural network; Spatio- Temporal Graph Neural Network; Total load; #forecasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, IJCNN 2022","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compared with aggregated electricity consumption forecasting, predicting residential load of an individual user is more challenging due to the stochastic and dynamic characteristics of electricity consumption behaviors. Existing methods did not fully explore the intrinsic correlations among different types of electricity consumption behaviors, which restricts the performance of these methods. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a residential load forecasting method employing graph neural networks (GNN) to make full use of the intrinsic dependencies among various types of electricity consumption behaviors. Specifically, two kinds of graphs are constructed to leverage the dependence information, i.e., short-term dynamic graphs are constructed for describing correlations among different appliances’ electricity consumption behaviors only a short time ago, while long-term static graphs are built to profile a more general pattern for the internal structure of individual electricity consumption. Both short-term and long-term correlations are restricted mutually through the fusion of these two graphs. GNN is then employed to learn the implied dependencies from both the fused graphs and time-series data for load forecasting.

It is of great significance to improve the intelligence of the power detection system to maintain the safety of the power system. However, the existing detection system relies more on traditional methods, which reduces the intelligence and accuracy of the detection system. Based on this, this paper proposes a power terminal detection method based on graph neural network. Firstly, the network flow data is used to model the power system as a node with no feature but sideband feature graph. Then, the graph neural network is used to iteratively learn the vector representation of each node in the communication topology according to the features of edges in the graph. Finally, nodes are classified according to the vector representation, so as to detect the vulnerabilities in the power system. When learning node representation, the proposed method considers the flow characteristics of power system and the communication topology of power system at the same time, and clearly considers the direction of edges in the graph. In addition, the proposed method is inductive, so it can adapt to the dynamic changes of power system. Experimental results on two public datasets show that the proposed method can converge quickly during training, and the Micro-F1 score of the proposed method is higher than that of the model that cannot use the power system communication topology information. Compared with other methods, the proposed method is easier to generalize to the unseen data during training. © 2023 The Authors.","2023","2024-06-26 09:43:09","2025-06-16 12:44:24","2023-08-12","1079-1088","","","42","","","","","","","","IOS Press BV","","English","","","Scopus","","","","0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 0 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] Journal Abbreviation: Adv.

However, the variable nature of wind energy poses significant challenges to WPF accuracy, especially when considering the complex mutual influence between wind turbines in wind farms. To address this issue, a novel neural network for WPF has been proposed in this study. The proposed model utilizes a gated dilated inception network and graph neural network to learn temporal and spatial features concurrently. Additionally, a novel mechanism has been developed to calculate the mutual influence between wind turbines and improve forecasting accuracy by incorporating the blockage effect on each turbine. The proposed model has been validated on a real-world dataset for wind power forecasting with a prediction horizon of 48 hours. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of forecasting accuracy.

In this article, we propose a novel approach for resilience improvement of power distribution networks, based on the notions of persistent homology and simplicial neural networks (SNNs) which are new directions in graph learning. In particular, tools of persistent homology allow us to capture the most essential topological descriptors of the distribution network. In turn, extending the convolutional operation to simplicial complexes on the distribution network, using the Hodge-Laplacian analytics, enables us to describe complex interactions among multi-node higher order graph substructures. Such higher order graph substructures are of particular importance in distribution networks, since a change in power demand at a load bus (or the power supplied from a substation) will produce a corresponding perturbation in nodal variables (such as the bus voltages) and edge variables (such as branch currents). We validate our new Higher-Order Topological Neural Networks (HOT-Nets) model for contingency classification of three test distribution networks, the IEEE 37-bus feeder, IEEE 123-bus feeder, and the 342-bus low voltage network. Our experiment results on two case studies (i.e., (i) with sensors placed at all the buses alone in the networks and (ii) with partial observability in the networks) indicate that HOT-Nets substantially outperforms 9 state-of-the-art methods, yielding relative gains of up to 14.04% in terms of system resilience classification. © 1969-2012 IEEE.","2024","2024-07-31 11:06:39","2025-11-17 19:11:35","","720-732","","1","39","","IEEE Trans Power Syst","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","7 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 6 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 6 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/8UHEANSN/Chen et al. - 2024 - Learning Power Grid Outages With Higher-Order Topo.ocr.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/ACGKKN2U/10105595.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/37IY2DMB/Chen et al. - 2024 - Learning Power Grid Outages With Higher-Order Topo.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/M4J9CNSY/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/SEMA5BBX/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/PRB84C73/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/M34698CJ/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/54NZKMIL/page-5.html","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10105595/?arnumber=10105595; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/59/10375287/10105595.pdf?tp=&arnumber=10105595&isnumber=10375287&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9MTAxMDU1OTU=","#done; graph neural networks; Graph neural networks; distribution network; Neural-networks; Electric power distribution; Complex networks; Directed graphs; graph learning; Graph learning; High-order; Higher-order; Job analysis; Resilience; Sensor phenomenon and characterizations; Sensor systems; Task analysis; #faults-reliability","Distribution networks; Data models; Sensor phenomena and characterization; Sensors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the classic numerical integration method, i.e. time-domain simulation (TDS), has been widely used in industry practice, it is inevitably trapped in a high computational complexity due to the high latitude sophistication of the power system. In this work, a data-driven power system estimation method is proposed to quickly predict the stability of the power system before TDS reaches the end of simulating time windows, which can reduce the average simulation time of stability assessment without loss of accuracy. As the topology of the power system is in the form of graph structure, graph neural network based representation learning is naturally suitable for learning the status of the power system. Motivated by observing the distribution information of crucial active power and reactive power on the power system's bus nodes, we thus propose a distribution-aware learning (DAL) module to explore an informative graph representation vector for describing the status of a power system. Then, TSA is re-defined as a binary classification task, and the stability of the system is determined directly from the resulting graph representation without numerical integration. Finally, we apply our method to the online TSA task. The case studies on the IEEE 39-bus system and Polish 2383-bus system demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

However, how to explore the interactions and integrate with sensor signals remains an open question. Considering that the sensor signals and their interactions in an industrial process with the form of nodes and edges can be represented as a graph, this article proposes a novel interaction-aware and data fusion method for fault diagnosis of complex industrial processes, named interaction-aware graph neural networks (IAGNNs). First, to describe the complex interactions in an industrial process, the sensor signals are transformed into a heterogeneous graph with multiple edge types, and the edge weights are learned by the attention mechanism, adaptively. Then, multiple independent graph neural network (GNN) blocks are employed to extract the fault feature for each subgraph with one edge type. Finally, each subgraph feature is concatenated or fused by a weighted summation function to generate the final graph embedding. Therefore, the proposed method can learn multiple interactions between sensor signals and extract the fault feature from each subgraph by message passing operation of GNNs. The final fault feature contains the information from raw data and implicit interactions between sensor signals. The experimental results on the three-phase flow facility and power system (PS) demonstrate the reliable and superior performance of the proposed method for fault diagnosis of complex industrial processes. © 2021 IEEE.","2023","2024-07-31 11:06:39","2025-06-15 18:55:51","","6015-6028","","9","34","","IEEE Trans.

In this regard, a real-time risk assessment method for CFs in power systems with high proportion of new energy is proposed. First, combined with historical statistical data and relevant national standards, a CF simulation model that considers the off-grid protection action of renewable energy units in the event of a power grid fault is proposed. The model is based on the continuous steady-state power flow model, which simulates the spread of CFs via continuous power flow calculations. Second, via introducing the concept of a fault graph chain, the electrical and topological characteristics of the continuous dynamic of the power system in the process of CFs can be described. Then, through continuous CF simulation and replay buffer, a data-driven method is used to calculate the CF risk index corresponding to the fault graph. Finally, a cascaded graph neural network is employed to fit the nonlinear mapping relationship between fault graphs and CF risk indicators.

Due to advanced computational capabilities, deep learning-based algorithms can significantly outperform traditional methods. However, these deep learning models are prone to adversarial attacks which are not well-addressed as traditional cyber attacks in distribution systems. More specifically, to capture the structure of distribution systems, graph neural networks (GNNs) are employed. Leveraging the backdoor attack model, we propose a novel graph-based adversarial attack algorithm for fault detection in power systems. It is further shown that the adaptable structure of GNN can make them vulnerable to adversarial attacks through graph motif insertion.

With the growth of building-level photovoltaic (PV) panels and other inverter-based resource (IBR) deployments in recent years, market retailers and distribution operators have had to deal with the additional operational and management challenges posed by unobserved energy flow if its behind-the-meter (BTM) configuration. Also, the intermittent and stochastic nature of IBR-based solar power introduces uncertainty into the net load forecasting of electric distribution systems. Hence, management and control with high uncertainty in load prediction due to unobservable PV is a technical challenge. This article presents deep-learning-based algorithms for BTM PV power generation using a limited number of sensors in a given distribution system and extending to adjacent geographical areas. The proposed BTM PV forecasting method is based on geometric deep learning - a spatiotemporal graph neural network by processing the relationship between data in a non-Euclidean graph structure. The predictions of short-term BTM PV are aggregated with loss estimation at the data aggregation point with the net load forecasting to compute the true load forecasting with superior performance. The developed BTM PV forecasting method significantly improved true load forecasting results, which were validated and analyzed using a collection of actual BTM PV and load measurements in a test distribution feeder. © 2007-2012 IEEE.","2023","2024-06-26 09:43:42","2025-11-17 19:10:17","","3425-3435","","3","17","","IEEE Syst.

These tools rely on precise topology and line parameters data, enabling advanced power flow algorithms for effective monitoring. To address this, data-driven models incorporating power systems physics are recommended. However, these models neglect dynamic neighbor node influences, impacting network structure learning. Additionally, gradients of loss function for power flow (PF) vary during backpropagation. This work introduces a dynamic weight-enabled physics-aware graph attention network (dw-P-GATV2). It encodes various dynamical topology structures and PF physics into the dw-P-GATV2 model and optimizes the loss function concerning both data and physics.

The existing UVLS technique has difficulty adapting and generalizing to new topology variation scenarios of the power network, which greatly affects the reliability of the control strategy. This paper proposes a UVLS emergency control scheme based on a graph deep reinforcement learning method named GraphSAGE-D3QN (graph sample and aggregate-double dueling deep q network). During offline training, a GraphSAGE-based feature extraction mechanism of the power grid with topology variation is designed that can better capture the changes in system state characteristics. A novel reinforcement learning framework based on D3QN is developed for UVLS modeling, which reduces overestimations of control action and leads to a better control effect. Then, online emergency decision-making is achieved. The simulation results on the modified IEEE 39-bus system and IEEE 300-bus power system show that the proposed UVLS scheme can always provide more economical and reliable control strategies for power networks with topology variations and achieves better benefits in both adaptability and generalization performances for previously unseen topology variation scenarios. © 2023 The Authors.

With the increasing integration of renewable energy resources into the grid, forecasting the demand for electricity is critical at all levels, from the distribution to the household. Most existing forecasting methods, however, can be considered black-box models as a result of deep digitalization enablers, such as deep neural networks, which remain difficult to interpret by humans. Moreover, capture of the inter-dependencies among variables presents a significant challenge for multivariate time series forecasting. In this paper we propose eXplainable Causal Graph Neural Network (X-CGNN) for multivariate electricity demand forecasting that overcomes these limitations. As part of this method, we have intrinsic and global explanations based on causal inferences as well as local explanations based on post-hoc analyses. We have performed extensive validation on two real-world electricity demand datasets from both the household and distribution levels to demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance. © 2024 The Authors","2024","2024-06-26 09:43:27","2025-11-17 19:11:37","","","","","16","","Energy.

For this reason, the knowledge graph (KG) has been applied in various applications in the power grid. By combining with machine learning, deep learning, and other graph computing technologies, the knowledge graph can effectively find out the useful information in the data, and use the existing data information to optimize the business process and help in decision-making. However, the knowledge graph in the electric power system has multiple nodes, heterogeneous edges, and complex structures, and the applications on the knowledge graph are shallow. The traditional graph neural network models do not consider much on the topological structure of input graphs, and thus the problems of low efficiency and high complexity come out. In order to solve the problems mentioned above, we proposed a multi-scale graph neural network with fast pooling in this paper. This model could improve the computing efficiency through the fast calculation of the pooling layer, and prevent the decrease of the test accuracy by introducing a multi-scale network structure. Also, the model could adapt to different sizes of input graphs, where the pooling layer gave a fixed size of output regardless of the input size. According to the experimental results on the popular benchmark dataset PROTEINS and the self-built dataset CEPRI-Transmission, the proposed model outperforms baseline models when considering both accuracy and efficiency. © 2022 IEEE.","2022","2024-06-26 09:43:27","2025-11-17 19:07:00","2022-03-25","619-624","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 0 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] Journal Abbreviation: Asia Energy Electr.

In addition to the fields of healthcare, education and cultural tourism, Metaverse will also have a profound impact on the power grid. The digital twin (DT) is regarded as the foundation of Metaverse, but its high cost hinders the broad application of DTs in power grids. In this paper, we propose a path to build the DTs in the direct current (DC) microgrid, which is a representative block in the future power grid with the penetration of renewable energy sources, forming Grid-Metaverse that can significantly reduce the cost and improve the interactivity. A model-based DT, which is originated from the physical model, and a data-driven DT, using the graph neural network with the data from the model-based one, are built together to illustrate this path and to show their roles in the Grid-Metaverse.

Therefore, it poses the challenge of developing an effective CS scheme for fast recognition of critical contingency, which is one of the major concerns of system operators. To deal with this problem, this article proposes an adaptive stability CS (SCS) scheme for operational planning. One challenge in developing the adaptive SCS for different cardinal points is data distribution discrepancy resulted from load/topology changes. To align data distribution between different domains (i.e., cardinal points), a domain-adversarial graph neural network (DAGNN) is developed to learn the domain-invariant features, so that the DAGNN model trained on the labeled source domain (e.g., peak cardinal point 2B) data can be applied to the unlabeled target domain (e.g., trough cardinal point 1B) data for SCS. To make the proposed SCS more efficient in dealing with power system data, a graph learning approach combined with graph transformer and graph isomorphism network is used in DAGNN to provide feature representations considering the graph properties of power systems, where nodes and edges refer to buses and transmission lines, respectively. Experiments on IEEE 39 Bus system and IEEE 118 Bus system have verified the effectiveness of the proposed model. © 1969-2012 IEEE.","2024","2024-07-31 11:06:16","2025-11-25 20:45:13","","1503-1516","","1","39","","IEEE Trans Power Syst","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","4 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 5 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 5 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/GGRFKXCB/10086543.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/XWVU7PM3/Lu and Bu - 2024 - Adaptive Stability Contingency Screening for Opera.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/YGUETWMP/Lu and Bu - 2024 - Adaptive Stability Contingency Screening for Opera.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/3NKM8UJK/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/VJC52XI3/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/96XRXFC8/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/2KGX7I4S/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/D3N74ZBR/page-5.html","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10086543?arnumber=10086543; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10086543&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9MTAwODY1NDM=","#done; Graph neural networks; graph neural network; Electric power distribution; Topology; Electric power transmission networks; Contingency management; Adaptation models; #Check; Power systems stability; Stability criteria; Stability criterions; Transient analysis; Electric power transmission; Computational modelling; Contingency screening; domain-adversarial adaptation; Domain-adversarial adaptation; rotor angle stability; Rotor angle stability; Stability contingency screening; #faults-reliability","Computational modeling; Power system stability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, a graph neural network-based online transient stability assessment framework is proposed, which can interactively work with conventional methods to provide assessment results. The proposed framework consists of a feature preprocessing module, multiple physics-informed neural networks, and an online updating scheme with transfer learning and central moment discrepancy. The t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding is used to virtualize the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The IEEE 16-machine 68-bus system is used for case studies.

Distinguishing different types of power fluctuation patterns based on fluctuation process analysis and training prediction models separately based on pattern partitioning results, is beneficial for improving the prediction accuracy of wind farm cluster power. However, existing pattern partitioning methods have a single perspective and have not yet formed a multi-dimensional evaluation routine to quantify the fluctuation characteristics of different patterns. Furthermore, for wind farm clusters, there is a lack of consideration of the dynamic spatio-temporal relationship between adjacent wind farm stations under different power fluctuation patterns. To make up for these deficiencies, this article proposes an ultra-short-term wind farm cluster power forecasting model based on power fluctuation pattern recognition and spatio-temporal graph neural network pattern prediction. First, the extreme points are statistically analyzed, and the wind farm cluster power is divided into different fluctuation processes. Then four indicators are summarized from the time stationarity and amplitude volatility of these fluctuation processes to guide the partition of power fluctuation patterns. Finally, considering the dynamic spatio-temporal correlation between adjacent stations under various fluctuation patterns, the spatio-temporal graph neural network is exploited for model training for each fluctuation pattern. After identifying the fluctuation patterns of the wind power series in the test set, the corresponding trained model is used to obtain the final prediction results. Experiments with other benchmarks show that the proposed method is superior on real wind farm cluster power dataset. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","2024","2024-06-26 09:43:27","2025-11-17 19:09:39","","1794-1803","","1","60","","IEEE Trans Ind Appl","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","14 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 11 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 11 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/7TVZDAMN/Liu et al. - 2024 - Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network and Pattern P.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/8J88XVZD/Liu et al. - 2024 - Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network and Pattern P.pdf; ; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/SD39DF52/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/MKP33SBC/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/I7HFQJ2I/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/5UE43DQ9/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/879PKW93/page-5.html","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10269018&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL2RvY3VtZW50LzEwMjY5MDE4; notion://www.notion.so/Liu-et-al-2024-9babd503ad6e4aa4870f4e25fb1320ec","#done; Graph neural networks; Correlation; Predictive models; Wind power generation; Wind farm; Wind forecasting; Weather forecasting; Electric utilities; Power generation; Spatio-temporal graphs; Electric load dispatching; Power forecasting; Spatio-temporal graph neural network; Wind farm cluster power forecasting; Wind farm clusters; pattern prediction; Pattern prediction; spatio-temporal graph neural network; wind farm cluster power forecasting; Evaluation metrics; Fluctuation; Multi-dimensional evaluation metric; Multi-dimensional evaluation metrics; Multi-dimensional evaluations; Pattern Partition; Pattern recognition; power fluctuation pattern partition; Power fluctuation pattern partition; Power fluctuations; #forecasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since topology control involves large-scale action space and is difficult to solve by traditional optimization methods, the reinforcement learning paradigm has been regarded as a promising solution in recent years. However, the effective action space of topology control is too sparse to explore a useful policy for conventional reinforcement learning. To explicitly utilize the hierarchical semantic information of different actions to reduce the exploration space, this paper presents a novel progressive decision-making framework that enables the agent to carry out an effective action of topology control in multiple stages like human operators. The proposed framework uses a graph convolution network to extract the node-level and graph-level features, that explicitly account for the topological information with different granularity concealed in the power system. Based on the features of different receptive field precision from coarse to fine, the framework distinguishes whether the power system is secure and requires intervention in the first stage. Then the pivotal node is located in the second stage, and the corresponding bus assignment action is performed on this node in the last stage. Simulation results on two different power systems show that the proposed framework significantly reduces the action space of topology control and improves performance compared with several state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2024","2024-06-26 09:43:27","2025-11-25 13:41:57","","","","","235","","Expert Sys Appl","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","8 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 5 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 5 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/NXU7JT7T/Liu et al. - 2024 - Progressive decision-making framework for power sy.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/77IGXWFU/Liu et al. - 2024 - Progressive decision-making framework for power sy.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/6S47H93J/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/V6H98JCB/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/SKC5KQA5/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/C4KUN2IP/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/595SQCS2/page-5.html","notion://www.notion.so/Liu-et-al-2024-f6c4f2510e9349c1a3ee6188b22179a8","#done; Costs; Graph neural networks; Power systems; Power; Deep learning; Deep reinforcement learning; Reinforcement learnings; Power system; Reinforcement learning; Electric load flow; Topology; Learning systems; Decision making; Electric power system control; Action spaces; Decision-making frameworks; Decisions makings; Power control; Progressive decision-making; Semantics; Topology control; #optimization-control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Emergency load shedding (ELS) serves as a fast and effective stability control scheme for power system after a risky disturbance occurs, which can suppress grid oscillation, recover system stability, and prevent cascading failure. Recently, data-driven techniques provide a new way to realize real-time ELS owing to their fast decision-making capability. This paper presents a risk-averse graph learning method for real-time ELS, where a graphSAGE model is proposed to fully capture the topology of power network and efficiently embed it into deep learning, and a risk-averse learning algorithm is used to avoid control failures induced by load under-cutting. The proposed method has been tested on New England 39-bus system and Nordic power system. The test results demonstrate the proposed ELS method can effectively reduce the overall control costs as compared to existing methods. © 2022 IEEE.","2022","2024-06-26 09:43:27","2025-06-15 18:55:54","2022-11-01","520-524","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","2 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 3 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 3 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

In this study, a transient stability assessment method based on the gating spatiotemporal graph neural network (GSTGNN) is proposed. A time-adaptive method is used to improve the accuracy and speed of transient stability assessment. First, in order to reduce the impact of dynamic topology on TSA after fault removal, GSTGNN is used to extract and fuse the key features of topology and attribute information of adjacent nodes to learn the spatial data correlation and improve the evaluation accuracy. Then, the extracted features are input into the gated recurrent unit (GRU) to learn the correlation of data at each time. Fast and accurate evaluation results are output from the stability threshold. At the same time, in order to avoid the influence of the quality of training samples, an improved weighted cross entropy loss function with the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) idea is used to deal with the unbalanced training samples. Through the analysis of an example, it is proved from the data visualization that the TSA method can effectively improve the assessment accuracy and shorten the assessment time.

However, the addition of new transmission lines to the existing grid topology can lead to the emergence of Braess's paradox or even trigger grid failures. Hence, predicting where to add transmission lines to guarantee stable grid operation is of utmost importance. In this context, we employ deep learning to address this challenge and propose a graph neural network-based method for predicting Braess's paradox in electrical grids, framing the problem of adding new transmission lines causing Braess's paradox as a graph classification task. Taking into consideration the topological and electrical attributes of the grid, we select node features such as degree, closeness centrality, and power values. This approach assists the model in better understanding the relationships between nodes, enhancing the model's representational capabilities. Furthermore, we apply layered adaptive weighting to the output of the graph isomorphism network to emphasize the significance of hierarchical information that has a greater impact on the output, thus improving the model’s generalization across electrical grids of varying scales. Experimental results on the IEEE 39, IEEE 57, and IEEE 118 standard test systems demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method, achieving prediction accuracies of 93.8%, 88.8%, and 88.1%, respectively.

While existing research has primarily concentrated on power systems at the transmission and distribution scale, this study pioneers the application of a graph representation learning convolution-based method for electricity and gas demand forecasting at the building level. The proposed approach demonstrates exceptional accuracy in multi-energy load forecasting by modeling apartment floor plans as graphs and integrating internal space data with outdoor weather conditions. In this innovative approach, a graph neural network captures intricate relationships within the building structure, offering a holistic representation of the energy consumption dynamics. To assess the efficacy of the proposed graph network, comprehensive evaluations are conducted across 15 smart buildings, comparing its prediction results with those of a widely used long short-term memory benchmark.

However, in recent years, data-driven analysis methods that are based on sufficient data have put forward higher requirements on the speed of power flow calculation. To build a more accurate and efficient neural network for power flow calculation, a physics-informed graph neural network-based model is proposed for faster calculation. Via minimizing the physics-informed loss function and using a pre-training/fine-tuning method, the proposed model is trained to follow the physical equations directly and can generalize to dynamic power networks. Physics-informed LOSS makes the proposed model more interpretable, since the calculation error can be evaluated by LOSS. Then cascading failures are simulated with the proposed model, and a pre-set factor ζ is introduced to balance the speed and accuracy of simulations. Finally, the accuracy of cascading failure simulations with the proposed model is verified in the IEEE 39-bus system, the 118-bus system, the 300-bus system, and a real-world French system.

Though existing graph neural networks (GNN)-based models achieve satisfactory prediction performance by capturing dependencies among distinct RPPs, the static graph structure employed in these models ignores crucial lead-lag correlations among RPPs, resulting from the time difference of the air flow at spatially dispersed RPPs. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel dynamic graph structure using multiple temporal granularity groups (TGGs) to characterize the lead-lag correlations among RPPs. A granular-based GNN called GGNet is designed to generate an optimal adjacency matrix for the proposed graph structure. Specifically, a two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) is used to quantify the uncertain lead-lag correlations among RPPs; secondly, a gate mechanism is used to calculate a dynamic adjacency matrix; Finally, a graph attention network (GAT) is used to aggregate the information on RPPs based on the well-learned adjacency matrix. Case studies conducted using real-world datasets, with wind power plants and photovoltaic power plants, show our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SoTA) ones with better performance. Compared with the SoTA models, the RMSEN and MAEN of wind power plants for 1–4 h forecast steps decreased on average by 22.925% and 13.18%, respectively; the RMSEN and MAEN of photovoltaic power plants for 1–4 h forecast steps decreased on average by 48.95% and 18.75%, respectively.

To conduct principled risk analysis, numerous Monte Carlo (MC) samples are drawn from the (forecasted) probability distributions of spatio-temporally correlated stochastic grid variables. The corresponding OPF and SCUC solutions, which are needed to quantify the risk, are generated using traditional OPF and SCUC solvers to generate data for training GNN model(s). The GNN model performance is evaluated in terms of the accuracy of predicting quantities of interests (QoIs) derived from the decision variables in OPF and SCUC. Specifically, we focus on thermal power generation and load shedding at system and individual zone level. We also perform reliability and risk quantification based on GNN predictions and compare with that obtained from OPF/SCUC solutions. Our results demonstrate that GNNs are capable of providing fast and accurate prediction of QoIs and thus can be good surrogate models for OPF and SCUC. The excellent accuracy of GNN-based reliability and risk assessment further suggests that GNN surrogate has the potential to be applied in real-time and hours-ahead risk quantification. © 2024 IEEE.","2024","2024-11-14 14:24:13","2025-11-17 19:10:58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","3 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 0 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/RVKUD3YB/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/36PJE7VY/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/ZI29QWDE/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/B5GXI6FG/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/N4IA5W7S/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/LGQD2M43/display.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/3AE8BSIP/Zhang et al. - 2024 - Power grid operational risk assessment using graph neural network surrogates.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/KQ9DRQA4/Zhang et al. - 2024 - Power grid operational risk assessment using graph neural network surrogates.ocr.pdf","https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207425653&origin=SingleRecordEmailAlert&dgcid=raven_sc_search_en_us_email&txGid=d7bef27f72c6fbfdead5abd9f8c2c61b; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.12309","#done; Power grids; Graph neural networks; optimal power flow; Graph neural network; Neural network model; reliability and risk; security-constrained economic dispatch; Optimal power flows; Risks assessments; Security constrained unit commitment; Operational risks; Quantity of interest; Reliability and risk; Security-constrained economic dispatch; #faults-reliability; #grid-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, cross-border power grids have emerged, i.e., those allowing electricity to be transmitted across different national transmission systems. Cross-border power grids substantially increase the sharing of highly variable renewable energy sources (VRE), leading to greater economic benefits and increased reliability. In Europe, the total volume of cross-border electricity that is exchanged comprises 13% of the annual net electricity that is generated. Current studies on carbon intensity forecasting, however, apply to individual regional power grids. In cross-border grids, the carbon intensity of a regional grid depends not only on that of its own electricity but also on the carbon intensity from the electricity exchanged with cross-border grids. Thus, if the cross-border electricity exchange is not captured appropriately, significant forecasting errors can occur. In this paper, we formulate a new Carbon Intensity Forecasting for Cross-border Grids (CFCG) problem by proposing and integrating carbon flows generated by cross-border electricity exchanges. The challenge is to capture the complex spatial and temporal dependencies that are involved. We propose a CFCG model based on a Graph Neural Network (GNN) submodel to learn the spatial dependencies and a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) submodel to learn the temporal dependencies. We evaluate the CFCG model using real-world data from the cross-border power grids in Europe involving 28 member countries. We compare five baseline models. Our results show that the CFCG model achieves an average improvement of 26.46% or 20.34% as compared to state-of-the-art forecasting models based on regional grids or one-hop neighbor grids, respectively.","2023-06-16","2024-06-26 09:43:56","2025-11-26 09:21:28","2024-04-18","361–373","","","","","","","e-Energy '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","4 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-11-26] 7 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 5 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 5 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 5 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/TZLML4BD/Zhang and Wang - 2023 - A GNN-based Day Ahead Carbon Intensity Forecasting.pdf; ; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/4AVVGAL9/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/VBHCHK5M/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/7SPSZSUU/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/E9L53P33/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/HM3MM3WH/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/87BG8UP2/Zhang and Wang - 2023 - A GNN-based Day Ahead Carbon Intensity Forecasting.ocr.pdf","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3575813.3597346; notion://www.notion.so/Zhang-Wang-2023-77a9d1d97df44aa5ad9c3538a24600c7","#done; Power grids; Graph neural networks; Neural-networks; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Grid model; notion; Electric power transmission networks; Renewable energy resources; Power generation; Electric power transmission; Carbon; Forecasting models; Carbon Forecasting; Cross-border Power Grids; Neural Networks; Carbon forecasting; Carbon intensity; Cross-border; Cross-border power grid; Regional grids; #forecasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the practical operation of power systems, the duration of fault states is short, while the system remains in a safe and stable state for a significantly longer period, leading to an imbalance in the training samples available. This imbalance can cause traditional machine learning classification algorithms to favor the majority categories of power system operational states, resulting in inaccurate evaluation metrics and reduced model generalization capability. To address this issue, this paper introduces a spatiotemporal dynamic graph neural network model for the identification of power system operational states. By incorporating class cost coefficients, focal loss, and cross-entropy in a joint loss function, the model adaptively focuses on the less represented operational state categories during training, improving classification accuracy on imbalanced and challenging samples. Moreover, the integration of temporal information and spatial topology information within the graph neural network enhances the model’s robustness and generalization ability in state identification. Experimental results on the standard IEEE 68-bus system demonstrate that, compared to traditional machine learning methods, the proposed joint loss with the spatiotemporal dynamic graph neural network model achieves higher accuracy in the identification of power system operational states, significantly improving classification performance on imbalanced samples with a 4.8% increase in F1-score, reaching a peak F1-score of 98.6%.","2024-05","2024-08-11 23:33:14","2025-06-15 20:06:34","2024-08-11 23:33:14","910-916","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 0 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/SI5LNX8R/10594213.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/D9MEHGRS/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/35YFSAIT/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/W5E4NESX/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/JHJ8HPWA/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/5GS7M3F6/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/QJAEJPUC/Zhang et al. - 2024 - Adaptive Identification of Power System Operationa.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/9HKF9FJF/Zhang et al. - 2024 - Adaptive Identification of Power System Operationa.pdf","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10594213?arnumber=10594213","#done; Graph neural networks; Power systems; Neural network models; Power; Power system; Topology; Machine learning; Dynamic graph; Dynamic graph neural network; Dynamic graph neural networks; Operational state; Sample imbalance; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Spatiotemporal information; State identification; #optimization-control; #grid-analysis","Accuracy; Training; Power system stability; Power system dynamics; Adaptation models; Stability analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2024 IEEE 4th International Conference on Electronic Technology, Communication and Information (ICETCI)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional networks suffer from poor broadband utilization and insufficient model generalization leading to the need for redeployment after network topology changes. In this paper, we propose the DenseGNN-DRL model based on the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework. The model improves the feature extraction capability of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for graph data through dense linking, and combines with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to improve the feature aggregation capability of the graph. This improves the overall feature extraction and aggregation ability of the model, and provides good support for DRL to make better routing decisions. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper has better routing optimization ability and generalization ability compared with the traditional DRL and GNN-DRL methods.","2024-07-31","2024-10-01 19:04:56","2025-11-26 09:34:24","2024-10-01","39–43","","","","","","","icWCSN '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","1 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-11-26] 1 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 1 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 1 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/44JF38Y5/Zhang - 2024 - Reinforcement Learning-based Routing Optimization Model for Smart Grid Scenarios.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/JL3HGSRQ/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/5PEBSXI5/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/CWQ6JHUI/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/8A3BM2SX/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/VK6UR3R5/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/TQ6RLXIM/Zhang - 2024 - Reinforcement Learning-based Routing Optimization Model for Smart Grid Scenarios.ocr.pdf","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3657529.3657534","#done; Graph neural networks; Features extraction; Graph neural network; Smart grid; Deep reinforcement learning; Reinforcement learnings; Feature aggregation; Routing; Route optimization; Routing optimization; Optimization models; High demand; Routings; #optimization-control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional numerical calculation methods have good interpretability but high time complexity. They are unable to cope with increasing amounts of data in power systems; therefore, many machine learning based methods have been proposed for more efficient power flow calculation. Despite the good performance of these methods in terms of computation speed, they often overlook the importance of transmission lines and do not fully consider the physical mechanisms in the power systems, thereby weakening the prediction accuracy of power flow. Given the importance of the transmission lines as well as to comprehensively consider their mutual influence, we shift our focus from bus adjacency relationships to transmission line adjacency relationships and propose a physics-informed line graph neural network framework. This framework propagates information between buses and transmission lines by introducing the concepts of the incidence matrix and the line graph matrix. Based on the mechanics of the power flow equations, we further design a loss function by integrating physical information to ensure that the output results of the model satisfy the laws of physics and have better interpretability. Experimental results on different power grid datasets and different scenarios demonstrate the accuracy of our proposed model.","2024-11-08","2024-12-13 17:39:28","2025-11-25 21:12:13","2024-12-13 17:39:28","113123","","11","34","","Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 0 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/FVSNV8JL/Zhang et al. - 2024 - Physics-informed line graph neural network for power flow calculation.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/TLHSXE26/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/LE5SINHD/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/G34FH2XJ/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/HDEA2Z6T/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/T3MBKPGC/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/5TUYDJVM/3319453.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/YQK4UPFQ/Zhang et al. - 2024 - Physics-informed line graph neural network for power flow calculation.ocr.pdf","https://pubs.aip.org/aip/cha/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/5.0235301/20241171/113123_1_5.0235301.pdf; https://pubs.aip.org/aip/cha/article/34/11/113123/3319453","#done; prediction; machine learning; article; human; diagnosis; nerve cell network; calculation; drug therapy; incidence; mechanics; velocity; #grid-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, in machine learning methods and other traditional methods, the prediction is always based on the time series of data nodes, and sometimes wind turbines near the predicted nodes are also applied. These methods have limitations in the utilization of the spatial features of the entire wind farm, and can only be used to predict a single wind turbine. Offshore wind farm data is more difficult to predict due to the more dispersed distribution of wind turbines and the intermittent nature of offshore winds. We proposed a data integration method, which can connect all wind turbines in a certain range of wind farms by their geographical locations and other related information to form a graph(one type of data structure), then superimpose these graphs in a certain period of time. Then, we proposed the SGNN(Superposition Graph Neural Network) for feature extraction, which can maximize the use of spatial and temporal features for prediction. In the four offshore wind farms used in experiments, the mean square error (MSE) of the method is reduced by 9.80% to 22.53% compared with current-advanced methods, and the prediction stability of the method has also been greatly improved.","2020-12-01","2024-06-26 09:43:56","2025-06-15 18:37:57","2024-05-15 04:34:38","145-157","","","113","","Future Generation Computer Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","79 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 81 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 81 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/Y4U3HCZT/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/MGQUJFCK/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/NCXCBRE8/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/RI6HBAV3/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/XIGE5Q4B/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/4M2IJG9D/S0167739X19330626.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/8RVLQAET/Yu et al. - 2020 - Superposition Graph Neural Network for offshore wi.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/H36EVNT5/Yu et al. - 2020 - Superposition Graph Neural Network for offshore wi.pdf","notion://www.notion.so/Yu-et-al-2020-ca57dc67724645ac86ab6845844c2b22; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X19330626","#done; #forecasting","Graph neural network; Wind power; Prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As numerical methods are too slow, the use of neural networks (NNs) is rapidly increasing. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and their variants have become one of the leading methods to learn graph representations. Power systems and in particular, distribution systems can be represented as graphs, and are characterized by often topology changes, which makes the consideration of the topology structure to be an important aspect when searching for a solution approach. Although GNNs have promising results for certain applications such as computer vision ones, considering its limitations, it still has a long way to go until becoming a leading candidate for PF based applications. This paper highlights the existing gaps and challenges in fully accepting ANNs and particularly GNNs as real-time solution engines for the PF problem in DSs. These gaps are analyzed under three categories: suitable architectures for the solution of the PF problem in DS, explicit vs. implicit incorporation of the DS topology information impact on the models’ generalization, and the limiting factors for GNNs implementation aimed at the solution of the PF problem in DSs. The paper also includes a discussion, suggestions and insights of overcoming these gaps in future research.","2023-03-01","2024-06-26 09:43:56","2025-11-25 21:19:02","2024-04-18 12:26:01","109005","","","216","","Electric Power Systems Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","15 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 8 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 8 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/CNTFRDPP/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/TDR5W6QH/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/8NMHEGRT/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/SQDNSTDR/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/KJS5DFDV/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/XPZYS3LQ/S0378779622010549.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/E6CX6F5Q/Yaniv et al. - 2023 - Towards adoption of GNNs for power flow applicatio.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/8CBCDMRL/Yaniv et al. - 2023 - Towards adoption of GNNs for power flow applicatio.pdf","notion://www.notion.so/Yaniv-et-al-2023-90b86a0cd08f417f9eda2072578835d3; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378779622010549","#done; Graph neural networks; Power flow; Power flow problem; Power flows; Electric load flow; Electric power distribution; Topology; notion; Smart power grids; Numerical methods; Real- time; Distribution system; Distribution systems; GNN; ANN; Distribution system control; Smart grid applications; System control; #grid-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PSSE is often formulated as a nonconvex and nonlinear least-squares (NLS) cost function, which is traditionally solved by the Gauss-Newton method. However, Gauss-Newton iterations for minimizing nonconvex problems are sensitive to the initialization, and they can diverge. In this context, we advocate a deep neural network (DNN) based ""trainable regularizer"" to incorporate prior information for accurate and reliable state estimation. The resulting regularized NLS does not admit a neat closed form solution. To handle this, a novel end-to-end DNN is constructed subsequently by unrolling a Gauss-Newton-type solver which alternates between least-squares loss and the regularization term. Our DNN architecture can further offer a suite of advantages, e.g., accommodating network topology via graph neural networks based prior. Numerical tests using real load data on the IEEE 118-bus benchmark system showcase the improved estimation performance of the proposed scheme compared with state-of-the-art alternatives. Interestingly, our results suggest that a simple feed forward network based prior implicitly exploits the topology information hidden in data.","2020-11","2024-06-26 09:43:56","2025-11-17 19:11:26","2024-05-02 08:48:19","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","9 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 4 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 4 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/SG84J3LW/9302932.html; ; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/R4WHFSNA/Yang et al. - 2020 - Power System State Estimation Using Gauss-Newton U.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/DZG3B246/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/7JKKWRW9/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/ZIV64THM/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/ANLPVD9Y/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/WSP5BAXS/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/QW4DZ3KM/Yang et al. - 2020 - Power System State Estimation Using Gauss-Newton U.ocr.pdf","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9302932; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9302932&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL2Fic3RyYWN0L2RvY3VtZW50LzkzMDI5MzI=; notion://www.notion.so/Yang-et-al-2020-6b88051233c54bf5bbdefa63cd7e4365","#done; Graph neural networks; Power system state estimation; Topology; notion; Smart power grids; Deep neural networks; Electric power transmission networks; State estimation; Topology information; #Check; Feedforward neural networks; Benchmarking; Gauss-Newton unrolled neural networks; Gaussian distribution; Least squares approximations; Newton-Raphson method; Closed form solutions; Cost functions; Estimation performance; Feed-forward network; Gauss-Newton iteration; Nonlinear least squares; Regularized state estimation; Trainable priors; #grid-analysis","Real-time systems; Computer architecture; Neural networks; Smart grids; Artificial neural networks; Voltage measurement; trainable priors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020 IEEE International Conference on Communications, Control, and Computing Technologies for Smart Grids (SmartGridComm)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Distributed new energy is widely connected to the grid, and massive heterogeneous load terminals are continuously connected. The traditional methods of relying on manual vulnerability mining, asset investigation, attack detection, and hidden danger disposal are difficult to apply, and there is an urgent need to form an efficient, easy to promote, and dynamic new model of network security protection. This article proposes an innovative two-stage anomaly detection method based on graph neural networks.

In this paper, a fault location method of distribution network based on improved graph neural network GraphSAGE-GAT is proposed, inspired by the advantage of graph neural network to capture topological features. In this method, the topology of distribution network was transformed into an adjacency matrix, and the electrical features of fault lines were superimposed into the model. The representation of graph nodes was learned through sampling and aggregating of neighbor node information by GraphSAGE, and the multi-head attention mechanism in GAT was introduced to improve the feature characterization, and then the fault location problem was transformed into a node classification problem. Finally, the method was verified in the IEEE09 node distribution network model.

Since redispatch strategies need to simultaneously satisfy complex transient constraints and the economic need, model-based formulation and optimization become extremely challenging. In addition, the increasing uncertainty and variability introduced by renewable sources start to drive the system stability consideration from deterministic to probabilistic, which further exaggerates the complexity. In this paper, a Graph neural network guided Distributional Deep Reinforcement Learning (GD2RL) method is proposed, for the first time, to solve the uncertainty-aware transient stability-constrained preventive redispatch problem. First, a graph neural network-based transient simulator is trained by supervised learning to efficiently generate post-contingency rotor angle curves with the steady-state and contingency as inputs, which serves as a feature extractor for operating states and a surrogate time-domain simulator during the environment interaction for reinforcement learning. Distributional deep reinforcement learning with explicit uncertainty distribution of system operational conditions is then applied to generate the redispatch strategy to balance the user-specified probabilistic stability performance and economy preferences. The full distribution of the post-redispatch transient stability index is directly provided as the output. Case studies on the modified New England 39-bus system validate the proposed method.","2024-06-29","2024-07-17 23:45:36","2025-11-25 21:36:15","2024-07-17 23:45:36","","","","","","","Uncertainty-Aware Transient Stability-Constrained Preventive Redispatch","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","0 citations (Semantic Scholar/arXiv) [2025-04-09] arXiv:2402.09263 [cs, eess]","","; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/MQCKDL7F/Wang et al. - 2024 - Uncertainty-Aware Transient Stability-Constrained .pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/Y6RHT3RC/2402.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/JGDRB3WB/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/SH3V34JM/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/QQXRM7XU/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/D99QMFU9/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/QJNVKGBR/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/89S2VGGS/Wang et al. - 2024 - Uncertainty-Aware Transient Stability-Constrained .ocr.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09263.pdf; https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09263","#done; #optimization-control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Systems and Control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2402.09263","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, Graph Neural Network (GNN) models have been widely utilized to forecast wind speed, which explicitly utilizes the correlation between turbine sites in a wind farm. However, it is challenging to appropriately construct graphs to characterize multiple latent but unknown interdependencies among turbines. This paper proposes a novel multi-site wind speed forecasting framework AG-MGAT, based on an adaptive gate mechanism enhanced multi-graph attention networks. In detail, the contributions of our work are threefold. Firstly, multiple graphs are explicitly constructed, which respectively measure the wind behavioral similarity and the directional causality between turbine sites. Secondly, to calibrate the potential misalignment of spatial-temporal GNNs using these task-agnostic graphs, an adaptive gate mechanism enhanced Graph Attention Network (GAT), AG-GAT, is innovatively designed, which uses a learnable adjacency matrix as gate to adaptively weight the sites' embeddings from the current GAT layer and these directly from the previous AG-GAT layer. At each timestep, the proposed AG-GATs working on the constructed graphs are used to extract the turbine sites' representations that embed the multiple correlations among sites, which are then sent to recurrent neural network for further processing the temporal interdependency. Finally, thorough experiments on real wind speed dataset are conducted and the experimental results show the superiority of our schemes over other state-of-the-art GNN-based forecasting schemes. © 2023","2024","2024-07-17 23:25:11","2025-11-17 19:06:04","","","","","372","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","4 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 4 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 4 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/VCAMIBCI/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/V3EFYVMG/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/BPYWQGH4/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/C3CIZYRB/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/CISU9623/page-5.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/3QF4EJ28/display.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/LBLNDFGX/Wang et al. - 2024 - A wind speed forecasting framework for multiple tu.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/H37ELXU9/Wang et al. - 2024 - A wind speed forecasting framework for multiple tu.pdf","https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196675898&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=6fb909a7748541c8caf74e5e125eb32d&sot=b&sdt=b&s=%28TITLE-ABS-KEY-AUTH%28%22Graph+Neural+Networks%22+AND+%22Power+Grid%22%29%29+AND+ORIG-LOAD-DATE+AFT+1718923841+AND+ORIG-LOAD-DATE+BEF+1719528641++AND+PUBYEAR+AFT+2022&sl=152&sessionSearchId=6fb909a7748541c8caf74e5e125eb32d&relpos=0","#done; Power grids; Graph neural networks; smart grid; Forecasting; wind power; Graphic methods; Spatial temporals; Temporal graphs; Wind power; Wind speed; artificial neural network; Gating mechanisms; Recurrent neural networks; Wind speed forecasting; wind velocity; Adaptive gating mechanism; Graph construction; Spatial-temporal graph neural network (STGNN); Spatial-temporal graph neural network; wind turbine; forecasting method; graphical method; adaptive management; #forecasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, a novel Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNN) model is proposed to detect and locate FDIA accurately. First, FDIA is proposed to be generated by regional state estimation where only measurements and topology parameters specific to the attacked area are required. Then, state estimation is performed to convert line flow signals into node state signals to reduce the impact of noise with redundant measurement information. Finally, STGNN is proposed to extract the temporal and spatial features. The proposed model is evaluated on an IEEE 14-bus system.

Power system preventive control is an important measure to ensure the safe and stable operation of power systems by adjusting the active generation and nodal voltage of generators. In this paper, a power system preventive control algorithm aided by a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based Transient Security Assessment (TSA) surrogate is proposed. A GNN-based fast contingency scanning model is constructed based on power network topology, which can predict the contingency scanning results rapidly only based on the power flow by transforming the original contingency scanning problem into the node classification problem on the GNN. The obtained GNN is then used as a surrogate model for TSA to speed up the solution of particle swarm optimization-based transient security-constrained optimal power flow. Numerical Tests are carried out in the IEEE-39 system and the test results indicate that the proposed method can significantly improve the efficiency without affecting the solution accuracy.","2022-11-01","2024-06-26 09:43:42","2025-11-25 21:27:08","2024-04-25 09:04:35","943-951","","","8","","Energy Reports","","2022 The 5th International Conference on Renewable Energy and Environment Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","1 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 2 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 2 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/PHC84I3I/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/28V6A8MQ/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/ZWBPURDP/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/YUQ9FX86/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/BMIWLYJ9/page-5.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/UY52RTFG/S2352484722022053.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/7CFSWYCK/Wang et al. - 2022 - Power system preventive control aided by a graph n.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/XE8IGGDC/Wang et al. - 2022 - Power system preventive control aided by a graph n.pdf","notion://www.notion.so/Wang-et-al-2022-8dcbb454a1a14e27bd6441574c3a6bba; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352484722022053","#done; Graph neural networks; Network-based; Power; Safe operation; Stable operation; Graph neural network; Renewables; Network security; Electric load flow; Topology; notion; Numerical methods; Electric power system control; Electric power system stability; Transient stability assessment; Transients; Power control; Artificial intelligence; Preventive control; Clean energy; Electric power system security; Constrained optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Transient security assessments; #faults-reliability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, most of the current neural network methods used for wind farm cluster power forecasting have the following three problems: (1) lack of consideration of dynamic spatio-temporal correlation among adjacent wind farms; (2) simultaneously forecasting all wind farms’ power to obtain the total power will produce numerous error sources; (3) ignoring the causal relationship among input variables. Therefore, to solve the above problems, this paper proposes an ultra-short-term wind farm cluster power forecasting method based on dynamic spatio-temporal correlation and hierarchical directed graph structure. Firstly, three different types of nodes (wind speed nodes, wind power nodes, and target node) and input samples are defined, and then the spatio-temporal correlation matrices that can describe the correlation of adjacent wind farms are also calculated. Secondly, directed edges are defined to connect different nodes in order to obtain the hierarchical directed graph structure. Finally, this graph structure with dynamic spatio-temporal correlation information is used to train the forecasting model. In case study, compared with other benchmark methods, the proposed method shows excellent performance in improving accuracy of power forecasting.","2022-10-01","2024-06-26 09:43:42","2025-06-15 18:37:53","2024-05-16 08:43:36","119579","","","323","","Applied Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","61 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 57 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 57 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/RVIC6VFD/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/HQPRI434/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/NRYSHAKD/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/CTXQN69R/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/ZWQM4D8Q/page-5.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/D4CVIWZ2/S0306261922008893.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/SR8HYDHU/Wang et al. - 2022 - Dynamic spatio-temporal correlation and hierarchic.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/G3JFLPT8/Wang et al. - 2022 - Dynamic spatio-temporal correlation and hierarchic.pdf","notion://www.notion.so/Wang-et-al-2022-587142994b3647249ec9dab3fc0876f6; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261922008893","#done; notion; #forecasting","Causal relationship; Dynamic spatio-temporal correlation; Hierarchical directed graph structure; Ultra-short-term; Wind farm cluster power forecasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding the underlining mechanisms of cascading failures can help in developing strategies to minimize the risk of such events. Moreover, a real-time detection of precursors to cascading failures will help operators take measures to prevent their propagation. Currently, the well-established probabilistic and physics-based models of cascading failures offer low computational efficiency, hindering them to be used only as offline tools. In this work, we develop a data-driven methodology for online estimation of the risk of cascading failures. We utilize a physics-based cascading failure model to generate a cascading failure dataset considering different operating conditions and failure scenarios, thus obtaining a sample space covering a large set of power grid states that are labeled as safe or unsafe. We use the synthetic data to train deep learning architectures, namely Feed-forward Neural Networks (FNN) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN). With the development of GNNs, improved performance is achieved with graph-structured data, and GNNs can generalize to graphs of diverse sizes. A comparison between FNN and GNN is made and the GNNs inductive capability is demonstrated via test grids. Furthermore, we apply transfer learning to improve the performance of a pre-trained GNN model on power grids not seen in the training process. The GNN model shows accuracy and balanced accuracy above 96% on selected test datasets not used in the training. Conversely, the FNN shows accuracy above 85% and balanced accuracy above 81% on test datasets unseen during training. Overall, the GNN model is successful in determining, if one or several simultaneous outages result in a critical grid state, under specific grid operating conditions.","2023-09-01","2024-06-26 09:43:42","2025-11-17 19:10:40","2024-05-16 08:42:07","109341","","","237","","Reliability Engineering & System Safety","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","34 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 30 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 29 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/DMC9HQCD/Varbella et al. - 2023 - Geometric deep learning for online prediction of c.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/4BZ7X7DE/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/9MMS7IGG/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/VKLGER3V/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/KGKH7ZYD/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/JG5EXXY6/page-5.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/5KIBAJ93/S0951832023002557.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/HNBV8C82/Varbella et al. - 2023 - Geometric deep learning for online prediction of c.ocr.pdf","https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/20.500.11850/613348/3/1-s2.0-S0951832023002557-main.pdf; notion://www.notion.so/Varbella-et-al-2023-0cae07d9522b46ba8c63d3106601e0b6; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0951832023002557","#done; Power grids; Graph neural networks; Neural network models; Neural network model; Neural-networks; Deep learning; Grid state; Cascading failures; Graph representation; Graph representation learning; Neural networks; Computational efficiency; E-learning; Power grid; Risk perception; Graph classification; Transfer learning; Large dataset; Failure (mechanical); #faults-reliability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, addressing the AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) effectively becomes increasingly essential. The AC-OPF, which is a fundamental optimization problem in power systems, must be solved more frequently to ensure the safe and cost-effective operation of power systems. Due to its non-linear nature, AC-OPF is often solved in its linearized form, despite inherent inaccuracies. Non-linear solvers, such as the interior point method, are typically employed to solve the full OPF problem. However, these iterative methods may not converge for large systems and do not guarantee global optimality. This work explores a physics-informed graph neural network, PINCO, to solve the AC-OPF. We demonstrate that this method provides accurate solutions in a fraction of the computational time when compared to the established non-linear programming solvers. Remarkably, PINCO generalizes effectively across a diverse set of loading conditions in the power system. We show that our method can solve the AC-OPF without violating inequality constraints. Furthermore, it can function both as a solver and as a hybrid universal function approximator. Moreover, the approach can be easily adapted to different power systems with minimal adjustments to the hyperparameters, including systems with multiple generators at each bus. Overall, this work demonstrates an advancement in the field of power system optimization to tackle the challenges of the energy transition.

These uncertainties require consideration in power flow analyses by calculating power flow across a spectrum of generation and load values. Traditional power flow methods, which rely on iterative solutions of non-linear equation sets, become computationally burdensome under these uncertain conditions. Surrogate models have been used to reduces the computational cost of power flow analysis under uncertainty. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained increasing attention as surrogates for power system simulations. However, GNNs, similar to other machine learning models, require significant amounts of training data. This paper proposes an innovative approach combining a multi-fidelity methodology with a GNN-based surrogate model for efficient power flow calculations. This model is trained using both high-fidelity power flow simulations and low-fidelity power flow simulations. Our multi-fidelity GNN model not only reduces the cost of generating training data, but also outperforms both single-fidelity GNN models trained solely on high-fidelity data and conventional neural network models. Additionally, the proposed model exhibits robustness to minor topology changes and achieves reasonable performance with unseen topologies. The model’s effectiveness is validated through simulations on standard IEEE systems.","2024-12-01","2024-10-01 19:07:10","2025-11-25 21:05:22","2024-10-01 19:07:10","111014","","","237","","Electric Power Systems Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","7 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 1 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 1 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02]","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/JYYK7Q8T/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/WWXPBHS3/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/RBHJJ9LS/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/5E9ZH4M5/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/3295SZI4/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/VHNYVKKD/Taghizadeh et al. - 2024 - Multi-fidelity graph neural networks for efficient power flow analysis under high-dimensional demand.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/IQSQI58Z/S0378779624009003.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/WEVVU3I8/Taghizadeh et al. - 2024 - Multi-fidelity graph neural networks for efficient power flow analysis under high-dimensional demand.ocr.pdf","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378779624009003?pes=vor","#done; Graph neural networks; Graph neural network; Neural network model; Load flow control; Load flow optimization; Power flows; Uncertainty; Demand response; Efficient power; Multi fidelities; Multi-fidelity data fusion; Power flow analysis; Power flow analyze; Renewable energy generation; Varying topologies; Varying topology; #grid-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By leveraging the graph neural network (GNN), the proposed random coarse graph attention and probabilistic spatio-temporal learning perform effectively for large-scale PV sites in terms of forecasting accuracy and model training complexity. Simultaneously, our method adaptively imputes the missing PV data, ensuring stable forecasting even with the extreme missing data. Simulation results show that AnyCast achieves 7−12% improvement of mean absolute error and 79−82% improvement of total GPU usage in model training complexity for over 1600 PV sites and achieves 4−36% improvement of mean absolute error for 364 PV sites under the 90% missing data.","2024-09","2024-12-13 17:35:09","2025-11-25 21:50:17","2024-12-13 17:35:09","581-587","","","","","","AnyCast","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] ISSN: 2474-2902","","; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/VJXDXD76/Song et al. - 2024 - AnyCast Efficient Graph Learning for Large-Scale PV Power Forecasting with Extreme Missing Data.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/YTDW82JP/10738089.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/CIG9ZY2C/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/LA9KEQM3/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/WILSFNRY/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/5E7GDTGJ/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/3NQQY55B/page-5.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/2MJ5DEP2/display.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/CUX68IKX/Song et al. - 2024 - AnyCast Efficient Graph Learning for Large-Scale PV Power Forecasting with Extreme Missing Data.ocr.pdf","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10738089&ref=; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10738089?arnumber=10738089; https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85210890571&origin=SingleRecordEmailAlert&dgcid=raven_sc_search_en_us_email&txGid=9484d6a209d36cd37953fe68d8871992","#done; Graph neural networks; Graph neural network; Renewable energies; Missing data; Photovoltaic power; Power forecasting; Probabilistics; missing data imputation; Missing data imputations; Multi-site; Probabilistic multi-site photovoltaic power forecasting; probabilistic multi-site PV power forecasting; Anycast; #forecasting","Accuracy; Training; Power systems; Forecasting; Probabilistic logic; Learning systems; Renewable energy sources; Simulation; Smart grids; Complexity theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2024 IEEE International Conference on Communications, Control, and Computing Technologies for Smart Grids (SmartGridComm)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Monte Carlo methods are the backbone of probabilistic power system reliability analyses. Recent efforts from the authors indicate that optimal power flow solvers could potentially be replaced with the policies of deep reinforcement learning agents, to obtain significant speedups of Monte Carlo simulations while retaining close to optimal accuracies. However, a limitation of that reinforcement learning approach was that the training of the agent is tightly connected to the specific case being analyzed, and the agent cannot be used as is in new, unseen cases. In this paper, we seek to overcome these issues by representing the state and actions in the power reliability environment by features in a graph, where the adjacency matrix can vary from time step to time step. By combining this with a message-passing graph neural network-based reinforcement agent, we are able to train an agent where the agent model is independent of the power system grid structure. For the actor part of this architecture, we have implemented both a deterministic agent being a variant of the Twin Delayed DDPG-algorithm, and a stochastic agent with similarities to the Soft Actor Critic-algorithm. We show that the agent can solve small extensions of a test case without having seen the new parts of the power system during training. In all of our reliability Monte Carlo simulations using this graph neural network agent, the simulation time is competitive with that based on optimal power flow, while still retaining close to optimal accuracy.","2024","2024-12-13 17:34:09","2025-06-15 18:55:39","2024-12-13 17:34:09","160175-160189","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","1 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 0 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] Conference Name: IEEE Access","","; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/5RQWBQV6/Solheim et al. - 2024 - Using Graph Neural Networks in Reinforcement Learning With Application to Monte Carlo Simulations in.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/F96NKMYX/10735201.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/8CR25F7D/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/C2V8LHHC/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/RWN364T9/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/GEBGDEUR/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/EMWP27C2/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/SM7XC7HW/Solheim et al. - 2024 - Using Graph Neural Networks in Reinforcement Learning With Application to Monte Carlo Simulations in.ocr.pdf","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10735201&ref=; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10735201?arnumber=10735201","#done; graph neural networks; Graph neural networks; Power; Reinforcement learnings; Power system; Reinforcement learning; Monte Carlo simulation; Monte Carlo's simulation; Power systems reliability; Optimal power flows; power systems; Time step; Novel methods; Optimal accuracy; reliability; #faults-reliability","Costs; Power systems; Power system dynamics; Monte Carlo methods; Power system reliability; Reliability; Generators; Stochastic processes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, existing multi-energy load forecasting methods have two main limitations: (1) they fail to consider the complex correlations between multi-energy loads and auxiliary features; (2) single time-scale feature extraction methods can result in the loss of critical temporal feature information. Therefore, multi-energy load forecasting remains a challenging task. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel multi-energy load forecasting method based on a multi-scale spatio-temporal graph neural network (MS-STGNN). Specifically, the proposed continuous graph learning module quantifies the correlations between multi-energy loads and auxiliary features using an adjacency matrix, while the graph convolution module aggregates feature information among neighboring nodes through the same matrix to improve the correlations between multi-energy loads and auxiliary features. The model's robustness is further enhanced by the feature attention module. Moreover, to mitigate temporal feature information loss, we develop a multi-scale convolution module that uses filters of various sizes to extract multi-dimensional temporal features of different time steps. Extensive experiments show that the MS-STGNN method has higher prediction accuracy and better generalization ability than existing methods on the IES dataset at the Tempe campus of Arizona State University.

In this study, we combine a graph convolutional network (GCN) and a Transformer network to address the aforementioned challenges. The resulting forecasting network termed “GTrans” extracts the spatial couplings among charging stations using the GCN and achieves charging demand forecast over time dimension by learning the long-term correlations encoded in the historical data. A real-world dataset from the city of Palo Alto was used for the model training and performance validation.

Many time-domain simulation (TDS)-based and transient energy function (TEF)-based methods have been proposed to assess the transient stability of the power system. With the wide area measurement system (WAMS) and the phasor measure units (PMUs) applied to observe the real-time data, methods of TSA based on the machine learning and data-driven are continuously studied. These kinds of methods can only assess the transient stability of the power system when subjected to large disturbances. However, these kinds of methods cannot infer the type of event which leads to the collapse of the power system. In this article, the gated graph neural network (GGNN) is applied to assess the power system transient stability and infer the type of event leading the instability of the power system. First, conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) is applied to generate unstable samples making the training data more balanced. With the balanced data graph-structured and used to train the GGNN-based TSA model, the GGNN-based TSA model achieves better performances. Finally, the real-time data is input into the trained TSA model and the transient stability of the power system is assessed. When the power system is considered unstable, the proposed TSA model can also infer the type of event leading the instability of the power system, classifying the unstable state to the corresponding event. Simulations performed on the New England 39-bus system verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2014 IEEE.","2022","2024-07-31 11:06:16","2025-11-25 20:48:15","","9320-9331","","12","9","","IEEE Internet Things J.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","21 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 17 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 17 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/ZDS7N7Z4/9614326.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/9UPF8VEJ/Zhou et al. - 2022 - Transient Stability Assessment Based on Gated Grap.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/DAKLLRG2/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/DGL9AM4I/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/G4WDXB6N/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/YDJB3RDM/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/TDRJUKXD/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/49UMBGBA/Zhou et al. - 2022 - Transient Stability Assessment Based on Gated Grap.ocr.pdf","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9614326?arnumber=9614326; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9614326&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL3N0YW1wL3N0YW1wLmpzcD90cD0mYXJudW1iZXI9OTYxNDMyNg==","#done; Graph neural networks; Power; Phasor measurement units; Learning systems; System stability; Transient stability assessment; Transients; #Check; Conditional generative adversarial network; Conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN); data balancing; Data balancing; event classification; Events classification; Gated graph neural network; gated graph neural network (GGNN); Internet of Energy; Phase measurement; Time domain analysis; Time-domain simulation; time-domain simulation (TDS); Time-domain simulations; transient stability assessment (TSA); #faults-reliability","Power system stability; Data models; Generative adversarial networks; Stability criteria; Transient analysis; Mathematical models; Time-domain analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper proposes a novel graph neural network (GNN) based model for the short-term voltage stability (STVS) assessment. Based on mainly the steady-state information as the inputs, the model can provide multivariate stability indices for each bus and adapt to minor topological changes. Both the fast voltage collapses (FVC) and fault-induced delayed voltage recovery (FIDVR) events can be identified. A modified multi-task learning (MTL) process improves the multi-index evaluation performance of the model. As the kernel of the model, a heterogeneous graph attention deep network (HGAT) with various types of nodes works to aggregate the local information and generate new features. Then several micro-detectors scan over the network to provide the STVS indices of each bus with only the feature vector of one node as input for the prediction. Comparisons on the test system show that the proposed method can provide fine-grained STVS evaluation and show good robustness in the scenarios of different dynamic load distribution and network topology changes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","2022","2024-06-26 09:43:56","2025-11-26 09:20:28","","","","","136","","Int J Electr Power Energy Syst","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","22 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-11-26] 16 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 16 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 16 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/SUNAQLWP/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/3YHM6ICD/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/LPSAGSC4/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/BLRDFBF6/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/C74N7XYM/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/5DVZ6NV7/Zhong et al. - 2022 - A method of multivariate short-term voltage stabil.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/HTIYFA48/Zhong et al. - 2022 - A method of multivariate short-term voltage stabil.pdf","notion://www.notion.so/Zhong-et-al-2022-2a5730909f234c109000bc253ee90580","#done; Graph neural networks; Deep learning; Data-driven model; Topology; notion; System stability; Heterogeneous graph; Short-term voltage stability; Time domain analysis; Time-domain simulations; Dynamic loads; Evaluation index; Heterogeneous graph attention deep network; Multi-task learning; Multivariate evaluation; Multivariate evaluation index; Simulation data; Voltage stability assessment; #faults-reliability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, real-world time series data is usually not well-structured, posting significant challenges to existing approaches: (1) The existence of missing values in multivariate time series data along variable and time dimensions hinders the effective modeling of interwoven spatial and temporal dependencies, resulting in important patterns being overlooked during model training; (2) Anomaly scoring with irregularly-sampled observations is less explored, making it difficult to use existing detectors for multivariate series without fully-observed values. In this work, we introduce a novel framework called GST-Pro, which utilizes a graph spatiotemporal process and anomaly scorer to tackle the aforementioned challenges in detecting anomalies on irregularly-sampled multivariate time series. Our approach comprises two main components. First, we propose a graph spatiotemporal process based on neural controlled differential equations. This process enables effective modeling of multivariate time series from both spatial and temporal perspectives, even when the data contains missing values. Second, we present a novel distribution-based anomaly scoring mechanism that alleviates the reliance on complete uniform observations. By analyzing the predictions of the graph spatiotemporal process, our approach allows anomalies to be easily detected. Our experimental results show that the GST-Pro method can effectively detect anomalies in time series data and outperforms state-of-the-art methods, regardless of whether there are missing values present in the data.

Existing approaches for this problem mostly employ either statistical models which cannot capture the nonlinear relations well or conventional deep learning (DL) models e.g., convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) that do not explicitly learn the pairwise correlations among variables. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method, correlation-aware spatial&#x2013;temporal graph learning (termed ), for time-series anomaly detection. explicitly captures the pairwise correlations via a correlation learning (MTCL) module based on which a spatial&#x2013;temporal graph neural network (STGNN) can be developed. Then, by employing a graph convolution network (GCN) that exploits one-and multihop neighbor information, our STGNN component can encode rich spatial information from complex pairwise dependencies between variables. With a temporal module that consists of dilated convolutional functions, the STGNN can further capture long-range dependence over time. A novel anomaly scoring component is further integrated into to estimate the degree of an anomaly in a purely unsupervised manner. Experimental results demonstrate that can detect and diagnose anomalies effectively in general settings as well as enable early detection across different time delays.

Due to the large number of nonlinear and non-smooth characteristics of highly electronic independent microgrid, it is difficult to analyze it by the traditional transient stability analysis method. In this paper, the independent microgrid controlled by virtual synchronization is taken as the object. Firstly, we compare the impact of detailed modeling of energy storage and simplified modeling on the transient stability, and then discuss the impact of current limiting link of virtual synchronous machine on the transient stability. Secondary, combined with the idea of graph neural network, we propose an independent microgrid transient stability evaluation model based on message passing graph neural network. The information corresponding to bus and transmission lines in microgrid is aggregated and updated by message passing mechanism, so as to depict the topological connection relationship of microgrid, and then consider the influence of topology structure on transient stability evaluation. Last, a WSCC-9 system with virtual synchronous machine is taken as an example. The results show that considering the energy storage detailed model and current limiting link can effectively improve the accuracy of stability analysis.

However, the existing methods for regional load forecasting often lack consideration of the differentiated load characteristics and the interrelationships between various types of loads. Particularly during extreme weather events, demand responses, and other special occurrences, focusing only on the overall trend of regional load changes can lead to significant forecasting errors. Additionally, under extreme weather conditions, various loads within a region exhibit different response patterns. This paper proposes a multivariate time series forecasting model based on an Adaptive Graph Neural Network (ADAGNN) to treat various load types as nodes in a graph network, adaptively constructing adjacency matrices through a graph construction layer to extract inter-load relational information; it also uses graph convolution and temporal convolution to capture different load change patterns in regional loads. Considering the existence of different scales of cyclical changes in time series, an initial dilated convolution method is proposed, endowing the ADAGNN model with the ability to adaptively select the size of convolution kernels to extract multi-scale features of the original series. Ultimately, the model outputs the forecast data for all categorized loads, and the regional load forecast is obtained by summation. A case study is conducted using regional load data from a province in China. Relative to the optimal model in the control group, the proposed ADAGNN model improved by 1.06%, 43.32%, and 42.24% in the MAPE, MAE, and RMSE metrics, respectively, thus validating its high predictive accuracy and scalability.  © 2024 IEEE.","2024","2025-04-04 10:01:34","2025-11-26 09:22:17","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-11-26] 0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-11-26] 0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 0 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] Journal Abbreviation: Conf.

In this paper, we propose a power prediction method based on the prediction of the cluster output pattern. We use the spatio-temporal graph neural network to extract the spatio-temporal correlation between wind farms.

In practice, there exists complex spatial correlation between wind power variables, which brings great challenges to the accurate forecasting of wind power. However, traditional deep learning-based methods mostly focus on temporal feature while ignoring the spatial correlation between wind power variables, leading to low forecasting accuracy. To explore the spatial correlation among wind power variables and extract temporal features simultaneously, we propose a double attention-based spatial–temporal neural network (DA-STNet). First, graph attention network is employed to explore the spatial correlation between wind power variables based on a graph constructed by maximal information coefficient, which can consider the combined influences of multivariate on the wind power output. Then, by incorporating causal reasoning and data-driven element-wise attention measures, a novel temporal attention layer is proposed to extract the temporal feature of wind power sequences. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on one self-collected and one public dataset with three different multi-steps ahead forecasting tasks, and the experimental results demonstrated that the performance of proposed DA-STNet is superior to the existing methods on both real-world datasets.

The construction of smart grid recognizes the importance of net load forecasting, which represents the difference between the demanded load and the renewable energy generation, and has a significant impact on power system monitoring and control. Recently, some Transformer-based models have shown excellent performances in load forecasting. However, most of them perform weakly in face of net load forecasting due to the lack of emphasis on the specific trend variations and the inter-feature dependencies in cyclical temporal patterns. To address the two issues, we present the PSGformer that consists of multiscale series decomposition, seasonal module and trend module, which can focus on unique properties that affect the accuracy of net load forecasting by processing different components obtained from the series decomposition. The seasonal module seamlessly introduces graph attention network into the Transformer to compensate for the capability of capturing local inter-feature dependencies. The trend module adopts a new segment-wise iterative approach to capture trend patterns. Compared to the six baseline models, PSGformer has higher forecasting accuracy and stability on four load datasets from different countries. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","2024","2024-07-31 11:06:16","2025-11-26 09:34:00","","","","","78","","J.

However, the existing solar irradiance forecasting methods only based on the historical power data and meteorological information of the local PV power station itself, which is difficult to obtain sufficiently accurate forecasting results. In this paper, we propose a short-term irradiance forecasting model based on Graph Neural Network (GNN) considering surrounding meteorological factors to further improve the accuracy. Firstly, the spatio-temporal correlation stations are constructed according to geographical location and meteorological information, and simulate the spatio-temporal correlation data around the target station by utilizing the satellite image-irradiance mapping model. Secondly, based on the complex network theory, a new index is proposed to evaluate the connectivity of the graph structure, which improves the predictive ability of the GNN model. Finally, the spatio-temporal correlation around the target site is mined through GNN model to achieve the short-term irradiance forecasting. The results show that the proposed method further improves the forecasting accuracy compared with models that don't consider surrounding meteorological factors. The reliability of the graph connectivity is directly proportional to the forecasting accuracy, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed index. © 2022 IEEE.","2022","2024-07-31 11:06:16","2025-11-17 19:13:02","2022-05-02","","","","2022-May","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","3 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 2 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 2 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] Journal Abbreviation: Conf.

The development of artificial intelligence technology provides a new scheme for modeling with strong spatial-temporal correlation. In addition, the existing prediction models are mostly ‘black box’ models, lacking interpretability, which may lead to a lack of trust in the model by power grid dispatchers. Therefore, improving the model to obtain interpretability has become an important challenge. In this paper, an interpretable short-term wind power prediction model based on ensemble deep graph neural network is designed. Firstly, the graph network model (GNN) with an attention mechanism is applied to the aggregate and the spatial-temporal features of wind power data are extracted, and the interpretable ability is obtained. Then, the long short-term memory (LSTM) method is used to process the extracted features and establish a wind power prediction model. Finally, the random sampling algorithm is used to optimize the hyperparameters to improve the learning rate and performance of the model. Through multiple comparative experiments and a case analysis, the results show that the proposed model has a higher prediction accuracy than other traditional models and obtains reasonable interpretability in time and space dimensions. © 2024 by the authors.","2024","2024-06-26 09:43:56","2025-11-17 19:12:59","","","","2","17","","Energies","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","3 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 5 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 4 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/XE4U9TAE/Zhang et al. - 2024 - Interpretable Wind Power Short-Term Power Predicti.pdf; ; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/28MESZDE/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/R39R35MP/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/XU82IQ8Z/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/W6BGHX8W/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/KGLJ6IDV/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/VS287ISF/Zhang et al. - 2024 - Interpretable Wind Power Short-Term Power Predicti.ocr.pdf","https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/2/384/pdf?version=1705048527; notion://www.notion.so/Zhang-et-al-2024-50a66de91c7b49f5afeac4faa16c0435","#done; Power grids; Graph neural networks; graph neural network; attention mechanism; Long short-term memory; Attention mechanisms; Interpretability; Spatial temporals; notion; Deep neural networks; Power predictions; Wind power; Weather forecasting; wind power prediction; Wind power predictions; Electric load dispatching; High-precision; interpretability; Prediction modelling; spatial-temporal characteristics; Spatial-temporal characteristics; #forecasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Energy systems are typically complex systems consisting of multiple subsystems that are coupled with each other. Before and after the occurrence of a fault, the system is generally in an abnormal or even harsh environment, which may cause a large number of randomly missing measurement data and make the application of fault diagnosis technology extremely difficult. In this paper, the graph attention network (GAT) is improved by a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for incomplete-data representation. The iteratively updated expectation of the GMM serves as the characterization of missing data, which significantly improves the ability to fill in missing data. The GAT fuses multi-source data according to the topology structure so as to comprehensively exploit the spatial information. The gated recurrent units (GRU) extract dynamic fault information from embedded spatial features and classify the time series into various fault types. Moreover, we propose a loss function in the form of weighted focal loss so that the fault-class imbalance issue brought by the data deficiency can be solved. The proposed uniform spatial-temporal graph neural network classification framework together with the GMM (GM-STGNN) can effectively improve fault diagnosis performance and is applied on an experimental platform of an authentic industrial estate. Results of comparative experiments under different conditions of both sufficient and deficient data illustrate the efficiency and advancement of the proposed method. <italic>Note to Practitioners</italic>&#x2014;This paper presents a fault diagnosis method for large-scale energy systems with massive missing data. The proposed GM-STGNN framework can be applied in complex energy networks consisting of coupling subsystems, such as power grids, heating networks, and gas networks. With an incomplete-data representation mechanism, the proposed method utilizes topology information to comprehensively exploit spatial features, it also recurrently transmits historical embedded features and extracts dynamic fault characteristics. Therefore, it can effectively improve energy-network fault identification accuracy when more than half of the sample exists vacant values randomly. In the training procedure, after pre-setting the model scale, data acquired by multi-source sensors is put into the model according to the real topology structure, and corresponding fault labels serve as the supervision. The statistical characteristics of missing data are learned with neural-network parameters until the loss converges. In practical application, the sampling data is divided by a time window of a few seconds. The missing data is mitigated by the estimated expectation of the GMM. Therefore, real-time fault classification results can be obtained with high accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by fault diagnosis of a typical distributed heating network under the noise influence. Benefiting from the ability to learn fault knowledge, the proposed method can be easily applied to new scenarios where the process data and topology structure of the system are known.

In recent years, the topology of energy systems has become more complex due to the use of technologies such as cogeneration, leading to multienergy coupling. Critical equipment and user nodes in these complex energy networks are vulnerable to a lack of sensor data or non-idealities in the measurement environment. There is an urgent need for a unified and robust fault-diagnosis framework for the overall system to identify faults even under non-ideal data conditions. In this article, to address the problem of fault identification and state prediction, a novel deep learning model is constructed based on graph-embedded recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with self-attentional layers. Unstructured data are put into the graph neural network to extract common spatial features. An additive attention mechanism is implemented in the graph attention network (GAT) to integrate multiscale node information. The graph operator is computed within a gated recurrent unit (GRU) that captures the full range of temporal features. In addition, loss functions are introduced for fault identification and state prediction. Data from an industrial park experiment platform are used for fault identification experiments. The advantages of the proposed approach are illustrated by comparative experiments with different levels of missing data. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","2022","2024-07-31 11:06:16","2025-11-17 19:11:24","","","","","71","","IEEE Trans.

Traditional model-based local or centralized control methods that rely on proper system parameters are difficult to mitigate rapid changes in power systems. Utilizing model-free/data-driven multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) has been recognized as an effective solution to active voltage control. However, existing MADRL-based control approaches trained solely on data are agnostic to the underlying real-world physics principles. Therefore, this paper aims to incorporate physical knowledge of regional distribution networks into MADRL's decision-making. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows. First, a novel physics-informed MADRL -based distributed voltage control method is proposed, which is still under a centralized training and distributed execution framework and only requires local measurements. Second, graph neural networks are employed to help MADRL agents learn graph knowledge (node features and topological information). Further, transformer is introduced to extract discriminative representations and ensure agents’ cooperative control. Third, we adopt a physics-guided architecture of neural networks in the actor network to stabilize the training process and improve sample efficiency. Finally, simulation results based upon modified IEEE 33-bus and 141-bus networks validate the proposed method's effectiveness, robustness and computation efficiency. © 2023","2024","2024-07-31 11:06:16","2025-11-25 13:40:29","","","","","155","","Int J Electr Power Energy Syst","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","11 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 11 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 11 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/XFTTVIRF/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/J6GXYKUH/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/SWVEG2RP/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/UQ69HWUX/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/9MSFK763/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/FNSCH3F7/S0142061523006981.html; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/QUUGX9RR/Zhang et al. - 2024 - Physics-Informed Multi-Agent deep reinforcement le.ocr.pdf; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/LZC3VMSW/Zhang et al. - 2024 - Physics-Informed Multi-Agent deep reinforcement le.pdf","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142061523006981?via%3Dihub","#done; Deep learning; Reinforcement learnings; Reinforcement learning; Electric power distribution; Topology; Learning systems; Electric utilities; Decision making; #Check; Voltage control; Multi agent systems; Multi agent; Efficiency; Active distributions; Control methods; Distributed control; Distributed parameter control systems; Distributed voltages; Distributed-control; Distribution system; Distribution systems; Electric inverters; Electric loads; Multiagent deep reinforcement learning; Photovoltaic inverters; Physic-guided learning; Physics-guided learning; Voltage regulation; Voltage regulators; #optimization-control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One essential application is the use of PMU data for real-time event identification. However, how to take full advantage of all PMU data in event identification is still an open problem. Thus, we propose a novel method that performs event identification by mining interaction graphs among different PMUs. The proposed interaction graph inference method follows an entirely data-driven manner without knowing the physical topology. Moreover, unlike previous works that treat interactive learning and event identification as two different stages, our method learns interactions jointly with the identification task, thereby improving the accuracy of graph learning and ensuring seamless integration between the two stages. Moreover, to capture multi-scale event patterns, a dilated inception-based method is investigated to perform feature extraction of PMU data. To test the proposed data-driven approach, a large real-world dataset from tens of PMU sources and the corresponding event logs have been utilized in this work. Numerical results validate that our method has higher classification accuracy compared to previous methods. © 1969-2012 IEEE.","2023","2024-06-26 09:43:56","2025-06-15 18:55:41","","617-629","","1","38","","IEEE Trans Power Syst","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","18 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09] 12 citations (Crossref/DOI) [2025-04-07] 12 citations (Crossref) [2025-04-02] Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/4QY8QN8U/page-1.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/3CPXWGA9/page-2.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/EZE9XM2N/page-3.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/K9NW2HQM/page-4.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/AHJVJVWV/page-5.html; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/GVCC683K/Yuan et al. - 2023 - Learning Latent Interactions for Event Classificat.pdf; ; /Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/RYYHJKQZ/Yuan et al. - 2023 - Learning Latent Interactions for Event Classificat.ocr.pdf","notion://www.notion.so/Yuan-et-al-2023-45cd5d31cdf54699ae7d243fcc58ff0f; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.01616","#done; Graph neural networks; graph neural network; Power; Phasor measurement units; Heuristic algorithms; Power system; Topology; Task analysis; Statistical tests; Phase measurement; Principal component analysis; Event identification; Frequency measurements; Heuristics algorithm; Inference engines; interaction graph inference; Interaction graph inference; Interaction graphs; Large dataset; phasor measurement units; Principal-component analysis; #faults-reliability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Renewables introduce new challenges to power grids regarding the dynamic stability due to decentralization, reduced inertia, and volatility in production. Since dynamic stability simulations are intractable and exceedingly expensive for large grids, graph neural networks (GNNs) are a promising method to reduce the computational effort of analyzing the dynamic stability of power grids. As a testbed for GNN models, we generate new, large datasets of dynamic stability of synthetic power grids and provide them as an open-source resource to the research community. We find that GNNs are surprisingly effective at predicting the highly non-linear targets from topological information only. For the first time, performance that is suitable for practical use cases is achieved. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of these models to accurately identify particular vulnerable nodes in power grids, so-called troublemakers. Last, we find that GNNs trained on small grids generate accurate predictions on a large synthetic model of the Texan power grid, which illustrates the potential for real-world applications.","2023-10","2025-05-21 15:08:14","2025-11-25 20:48:30","","103103","","10","33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","tex.eprint: https://pubs.aip.org/aip/cha/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/5.0160915/19668761/103103\_1\_5.0160915.pdf","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/Z8HIY3Y8/Nauck et al. - 2023 - Toward dynamic stability assessment of power grid topologies using graph neural networks.pdf","","#done; graph neural network; prediction; article; controlled study; renewable energy; climate change; simulation; decentralization; major clinical study; volatilization; #faults-reliability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To ensure the stable operation of power systems, the accurate recognition of PQD is both critical and challenging. This paper proposes a novel method for PQD recognition based on adaptive Fourier decomposition (AFD) and graph convolutional network (GCN), referred to as the AFD-GCN scheme. The architecture of the AFD-GCN scheme consists of three main stages: signal analysis, feature extraction, and PQD recognition. First, AFD is used to sparsely represent PQD signals. Based on AFD, the transient time-frequency distribution (TTFD) and marginal distribution (MD) are utilized to analyze the signal, which provides a novel perspective for the signal analysis. Second, ten feature calculation methods based on AFD are proposed, which establishes clear decision boundaries that enable reliable differentiation between distinct PQD classes. Third, considering the potential relationships between different PQD classes, a graph describing their connections is constructed. Finally, the AFD-based features and graph structure are input into the GCN to achieve the PQD recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed AFD-GCN scheme achieves outstanding performance in PQD recognition under challenging conditions. On synthetic signals with high noise energy, the AFD-GCN scheme attains a recognition accuracy of 99.57%. When applied to real-world signals, it maintains a high accuracy of 99.17%. Under identical conditions, the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms other popular PQD recognition schemes, confirming its superior accuracy, robustness, and practical applicability. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2026","2025-11-17 18:58:41","2025-11-25 16:21:34","","","","","251","","Electr Power Syst Res","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/QXAYFNK8/Qiu et al. - 2026 - Recognition of power quality disturbances using AFD based features and graph convolutional network.pdf","","#done; Convolutional networks; Graph convolutional network; Features extraction; Power; Convolution; Graph theory; Graphic methods; Feature extraction; Graph structures; Extraction; Transient analysis; Power quality; Quality control; Adaptive Fourier decomposition; Adaptive fourier decompositions; Continuous development; Marginal distribution; Network scheme; Power quality disturbance; Power quality disturbances; Signal analysis; Signals analysis; #faults-reliability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By incorporating fractional Laplacian operators with learnable fractional orders γ∈(0,1), FO-GNN captures the subdiffusive propagation characteristics inherent in cascading failures. We establish theoretical connections between discrete fractional graph operators and continuous anomalous diffusion PDEs, providing mathematical justification for our approach. Comprehensive evaluation on IEEE test systems (14-300 buses) demonstrates FO-GNN's superiority across fault detection (AUC-ROC: 0.890), cascading failure prediction (0.830), and stability classification (accuracy: 0.910), achieving 2.27%–3.75% improvements over state-of-the-art baselines with p<0.001 significance. The optimal fractional order converges to γ∗=0.5, confirming subdiffusive dynamics in power systems. Physics-constrained learning incorporating Kirchhoff's laws yields additional 4.82% performance gains while ensuring physical feasibility. Robustness analysis reveals 39.4% improved gradient stability and 58.8% spectral integrity retention under perturbations. Despite 2.1-2.5× computational overhead, inference throughput of 169.5 samples/second exceeds SCADA requirements, confirming practical viability.

The architecture is integrated into the Versal AI edge platform, supported by a PyTorch-based hardware-software co-design framework. Fine-grained dynamic bit-level protection and inter-cluster fault detectors are introduced to mitigate the impact of bit-level and cluster-level soft errors, fully exploiting the potential fault-tolerant properties of the graph structure.

The high computational cost of traditional power flow solvers limits their applicability in practice. Machine learning (ML) surrogates such as deep neural networks (NNs) accelerate power flow solvers computations, enabling high-order contingency analysis and real-time decision-making by learning highly nonlinear functions and integrating grid topology via graph architectures. However, (graph) NNs lack predictive power away from training data and do not provide predictive confidence estimates. We present a Bayesian residual graph NN that integrates knowledge from low-fidelity data via residual training and embeds granular quantification of uncertainties, improving trustworthiness critical for high-consequence decision-making. Applying Bayesian concepts to NNs is challenging due to the high-dimensionality of both the parameter space, complicating derivation of a meaningful prior, and the output space in large grid systems, requiring enhanced techniques to assess the predicted high-dimensional uncertainties. Our contributions include: (1) Deriving a prior for fully connected and graph NNs that leverages low-fidelity data to guide mean predictions and appropriately control prior predictive uncertainty. (2) Integrating this prior within an ensembling with anchoring scheme for efficient approximate posterior inference. (3) Deriving enhanced metrics to assess accuracy of both the mean and uncertainty predictions in high dimensions, appropriately accounting for correlations propagated through graph layers.

To address the non-stationarity of multi-energy loads, a Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) enhanced Temporal Convolutional Network-Graph Convolutional Network-Long Short-Term Memory (TCN-GCN-LSTM) spatiotemporal fusion model is developed, achieving significant improvements in forecasting accuracy compared to benchmark models.

Traditional anomaly detection methods primarily focus on one single energy load, often neglecting potential spatial correlations between multivariate energy time series. Meanwhile, addressing the imbalanced nature of user-level multi-energy load data remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose EGBAD, an Ensemble Graph-Boosted Anomaly Detection framework for user-level multi-energy load that leverages the advantages of graph relational analysis and ensemble learning. First, a dynamic graph construction method based on multidimensional scaling (MDS) is proposed to transform multi-energy load data into graph representations. These graphs are subsequently processed using graph convolutional network (GCN) to capture the spatiotemporal correlations between multi-energy load time series. In addition, to improve detection robustness under class imbalance, the entire training process is embedded within a Boosting ensemble learning framework, where the weight assigned to the minority class is progressively increased at each boosting stage. Experimental results on publicly real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior anomaly detection accuracy compared to most baseline methods. Notably, it performs especially well in scenarios characterized by extreme data imbalance, achieving the highest recall and F1-score for anomaly detection. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:42","2025-11-25 16:21:34","","","","","22","","Energy.

As energy infrastructures become increasingly integrated, the risk of cascading failures across these networks grows, making it critical to develop robust models for predicting and mitigating fault propagation. To tackle the complexity of fault propagation in interconnected energy systems, we develop a novel AI-based management architecture that couples adversarial learning mechanisms with graph-structured predictive models. Specifically, a generative network is employed to synthesize plausible fault evolution patterns from historical records, while a graph-based neural architecture captures the spatiotemporal correlations among the subsystems. Furthermore, a robust optimization scheme under distributional uncertainty is incorporated to devise adaptive recovery strategies, enhancing the resilience and reliability of system restoration processes. The proposed model is tested using a synthetic case study based on the IEEE 123-bus electric network, the Belgian gas transmission system, and a standard heating network. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in accurately predicting fault propagation and optimizing recovery strategies, significantly reducing recovery time and minimizing the impact of cascading failures. The primary innovations presented in this study are the development of an integrated fault propagation framework spanning multiple energy networks, the pioneering use of adversarial and graph-based learning techniques for fault trajectory prediction, and the incorporation of distributionally robust optimization to strengthen recovery planning. Collectively, these advancements contribute to a deeper understanding of fault dynamics in interconnected infrastructures and propose a scalable pathway for enhancing system resilience in modern energy networks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:42","2025-11-25 14:02:53","","","","1","15","","Sci.

Hence, this paper proposes a novel power based CPI methodology applying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The CPI methodology generates synthetic transformer power profiles assuming random combinations of phases for the measured load profiles, which are used altogether to train the GNN model. The GNN model is then tested using measured transformer and load power profiles. The performance of the methodology is evaluated in a test low voltage grid of 55 loads under various conditions of Photovoltaic penetration, Photovoltaics under maintenance, measurement errors, unmetered consumption, uncertain grid asset parameters and inaccurate phase connections. Further tests on a real low voltage grid with 111 loads prove the scalability of the methodology.

These strategies struggle to balance multi-objective requirements, such as reducing network losses, ensuring voltage stability, and accommodating renewable energy. Existing approaches often neglect critical interactions among network topology, reactive power compensation, and active power regulation, leading to compromised performance under high DG penetration. This paper proposes a multi-agent graph reinforcement learning framework for multi-timescale coordinated rolling optimization of topology, reactive power, and active power. Our method integrates graph convolutional networks to model grid-structured data and double deep Q-networks to address complex decision-making. By hierarchically coordinating slow- and fast-timescale resources through rolling optimization, it adaptively manages stochastic fluctuations in DG outputs and loads. Case studies demonstrate enhanced cross-timescale coordination, achieving higher renewable utilization, stabilized voltage profiles, improved operational flexibility, and robust uncertainty handling capabilities. Furthermore, the framework exhibits excellent scalability and computational efficiency, enabling effective optimization even for large-scale distribution networks, which is critical for practical deployments in complex high-renewable scenarios.

Following such failures, topological reconfiguration and load adjustments can cause some transmission lines to enter a “subcritical overload” state,where power flow exceeds stability limits without triggering protection leading to latent faults and secondary collapse risks. To tackle this, this paper proposes a Node and Edge Attributed Graph Edge-Attention Residual Network (NEA-GEAT-Res) for predicting potentially overloaded lines. Using IEEE test cases with random and clustered faults, we simulate cascading failures via an AC-Cascading Failure Model (AC-CFM). Post-failure, lines are classified as failed, normal, or hazardous. Based on the NEA-GNN framework, our model introduces cross-layer residual connections to preserve initial features and mitigate over-smoothing, alongside an edge attention mechanism that dynamically weights critical line information. Experiments show that NEA-GEAT-Res achieves F1-scores of 96.42 % (IEEE 39-bus) and 84.59 % (IEEE 118-bus), improving over baseline NEA-GNN by 16.79 % and 14.87 %, and outperforming other mainstream models. Notably, adding topological features benefits baseline models (3 %–11 % F1 improvement) but not NEA-GEAT-Res, indicating our model effectively captures dynamic grid characteristics through residual and attention mechanisms.

This study addresses the problem by developing a Spectral-Attentive Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (SA-STGCN) designed to capture the intricate temporal and spatial dependencies of wind systems. The approach first applies wavelet transform decomposition to separate volatile wind signals into distinct frequency components, enabling more interpretable representation of rapidly changing conditions. A dynamic temporal attention mechanism is then employed to adaptively identify historical patterns that are most relevant for prediction, moving beyond the fixed temporal windows used in many existing methods. In addition, spectral graph convolution is conducted in the frequency domain to capture farm-wide spatial correlations, thereby modeling long-range atmospheric interactions that conventional localized methods overlook. Although this design increases computational complexity, it proves critical for representing wind variability. Evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates that SA-STGCN achieves substantial accuracy improvements, with a mean absolute error of 1.52 and a root mean square error of 2.31. These results suggest that embracing more expressive architectures can yield reliable forecasting performance, supporting the stable integration of wind power into modern energy systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:42","2025-11-25 14:02:42","","","","19","18","","Energies","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/GZSA6AGW/Yang et al. - 2025 - SA-STGCN A Spectral-Attentive Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Wind Power Forecastin.pdf","","#done; Convolutional networks; Convolution; Wind power forecasting; Complex networks; Wind power; Weather forecasting; Spatio-temporal graphs; Multi-scales; Mean square error; wind power forecasting; Wavelet decomposition; Wavelets transform; Spatio-temporal learning; Frequency domain analysis; Conventional modeling; Renewable energy integrations; spatio-temporal learning; spectral graph convolution; Spectral graph convolution; temporal attention; Temporal attention; wavelet transform; Wind power integration; #forecasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The optimal operation of these networks can be accomplished using optimal power flow (OPF), a fundamental optimisation tool for power networks with objectives including generation cost minimisation. Whilst the OPF problem itself is not new, quickly solving problems of a practical scale remains an active research area. Two approaches here are distributed optimisation and, more recently, machine learning (ML). Distributed optimisation improves scalability, avoids single points of failure, and enhances user privacy, whilst ML has the potential to provide solutions significantly faster than traditional optimisation methods. The goal of this review is to present approaches that overlap both areas, identifying complementary aspects as well as areas for further exploration. For example, one drawback of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), a distributed optimisation algorithm, is that it has slow convergence. Several reviewed papers have mitigated this by using ML to accelerate convergence through the prediction of consensus variable values, demonstrating improvements in terms of convergence time. Challenges remain, including the generalisation of results across different network topologies, something with the potential to be addressed with additional ML models such as graph neural networks (GNNs). Further areas to explore at the intersection of these two fields are identified, including augmented Lagrangian alternating direction inexact Newton (ALADIN) and overlapping Schwarz decomposition optimisation methods, as well as ML models such as GNNs and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2026","2025-11-17 18:58:42","2025-11-25 21:51:40","","","","","226","","Renewable Sustainable Energy Rev","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/95V86EQR/Steven et al. - 2026 - Machine learning-accelerated distributed optimisation methods for optimal power flow A review.pdf","","#done; Power grids; Graph neural networks; Reinforcement learnings; Reinforcement learning; Topology; Learning systems; Machine-learning; System stability; Machine learning; Neural networks; Renewable energy; Optimal power flows; Optimal power flow; Machine learning models; AS graph; Alternating direction method of multipliers; Alternating directions method of multipliers; Distributed optimisation; Distributed optimization; Operating costs; Optimization method; Problem solving; #survey","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper uses the connection relationship between distribution transformers and voltage transformers to predict the secondary voltage of voltage transformers through the secondary voltage of transformers, constructing a voltage transfer characteristic model between the two to achieve accurate evaluation of voltage transformer errors. To address the challenge of extracting complex nonlinear features from multivariate electrical data, a combined model of a self-attention mechanism and a graph convolutional network (GCN) is proposed. The self-attention mechanism captures global dependencies among power parameters, while the GCN effectively constructs the multivariate data structures in distribution networks. By integrating both approaches, the model can fully extract the intrinsic features of the data as well as the hidden dependency information between data points. Additionally, to prevent gradient vanishing as the combined model’s structure deepens, a multi-head residual structure is introduced to enhance the self-attention mechanism. Experimental results show that compared to a single model, the proposed combined model reduces the mean squared error by 82.35% and increases the coefficient of determination R2 by 9.07%, demonstrating significant accuracy advantages in voltage transformer error evaluation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:42","2025-11-26 08:19:09","","","","1","8","","Energy.

To this end, an intelligent information system for power grid fault analysis, leveraging improved computer communication technology, is proposed and developed. The system incorporates a novel fault diagnosis model, combining advanced communication technologies such as distributed computing, real-time data transmission, cloud computing, and big data analytics, to establish a multi-layered information processing architecture for grid fault analysis. Specifically, this study introduces a fusion model integrating Transformer self-attention mechanisms with graph neural networks (GNNs) based on conventional fault diagnosis techniques. GNNs capture the complex relationships between different nodes within the grid topology, effectively identifying power transmission characteristics and fault propagation paths across grid nodes. The Transformer’s self-attention mechanism processes time-series operational data from the grid, enabling precise identification of temporal dependencies in fault characteristics. To improve system response speed, edge computing moves portions of fault data preprocessing and analysis to edge nodes near data sources, significantly reducing transmission latency and enhancing real-time diagnosis capability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior diagnostic performance across various fault types (e.g., short circuits, overloads, equipment failures) in simulation scenarios. The system achieves a fault identification and location accuracy of 99.2%, an improvement of over 10% compared to traditional methods, with an average response time of 85 milliseconds, approximately 43% faster than existing technologies. Moreover, the system exhibits strong robustness in complex scenarios, with an average fault prediction error rate of just 1.1% across multiple simulations.

Recently, as the typical implementation and application of Artificial intelligence (AI) in energy field, Graph Neural Network (GNN) based RLF has emerged as a promising paradigm, since GNN can learn from graph-structured data, and capture complex interactions among nodes in a graph. However, it is challenging to build graphs that can effectively characterize the multiple unknown dependencies among residential users. To address the above issue, this paper proposes an effective residential load forecasting framework, based on intentionally constructed multiple ego-centric networks as well as multiple correlations and temporal graph neural networks. This work's contributions are given as follows. First, from two aspects: correlation and causality, multiple personalized ego-centric networks are intentionally constructed through data-mining manner, which respectively characterize the electricity consumption similarity between households, and direct influences on ego from the ego's neighbors (so-called alters) who essentially affect the ego's RLF. Second, multiple-correlation and temporal graph neural networks are adopted to forecast the ego's load. In detail, at each timestep, the ego node's hidden feature is embedded by multiple GNNs to represent multi-correlation dependencies between the ego and its alters, then the formed feature is sent to a recurrent neural network for further learning the spatial-temporal features. Finally, thorough experiments on real datasets demonstrate that our proposal outperforms the state-of-the-art spatial-temporal GNN-based forecasting schemes. Moreover, the empirical results verify that, for the load forecasting of single ego household, data-mining based personalized graphs can indeed significantly improve the forecasting accuracy, while the formulated personalized graphs are really sparsification and locality, which reflects the intuition that there are only relatively few useful relations in graphs based RLF.

However, existing short-term forecasting methods do not delve deeply into the interpretability of input features. They rely on static correlation analysis methods for processing numerical weather prediction (NWP), and often overlook the crucial step of correcting power forecasting errors. Addressing these three research deficiencies, this study develops a short-term PV power forecasting method employing a dynamic spatiotemporal attention graph convolutional network (STAGCN) with decomposition-based error correction. Initially, the spatio-temporal importance model explanation method is employed for feature extraction from multiple NWP sources, identifying key features for model forecasting. Furthermore, the spatiotemporal feature transformation and fusion technique is incorporated to construct a dynamic adjacency matrix and spatiotemporal dynamic graph structure using derived multi-source features. This structure feeds into the STAGCN model, yielding initial forecasting results. Ultimately, the improved complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise and variational mode decomposition, long short-term memory network and mixed kernel density estimation are utilized for the decomposition and forecasting of error sequences, subsequently refining the preliminary forecasting results. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed forecasting approach enhances model interpretability, reduces forecasting errors, and achieves improved forecasting accuracy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:42","2025-11-25 14:02:42","","","","","300","","Sol.

Inspired by Graph Neural Networks (GNN), which can capture the topological structure of graph data, this paper proposes a novel multi-energy forecasting framework with multi-level task-sharing matrices (MTMs), which connects multiple tasks to capture the coupling characteristics between multiple loads. The proposed framework overwhelms most traditional multi-task approaches because traditional models usually have shared parameters in only one stage, which reserves representation space for temporal features of individual loads but limits their ability to capture multi-task correlations across multiple stages. Specifically, the proposed framework can capture coupling features across various stages of the entire model by MTMs, significantly enhancing the connections among multiple tasks while preserving adequate representation space for temporal features. The combination of graph attention and graph convolution can further expand the representational space of coupling features, so that multi-head attention can focus on capturing the temporal characteristics of individual loads. In addition, a gradient-based multi-task balance method is proposed to adapt to the above framework, which can balance different tasks by normalizing the weights by MTMs. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed framework has superior forecasting performance for multi-energy loads. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:43","2025-11-25 14:02:42","","","","","172","","Int J Electr Power Energy Syst","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/WPLP7XKL/Wang et al. - 2025 - Short-term load forecasting method for integrated energy systems based on graph neural network and m.pdf","","#done; Graph neural networks; Graph neural network; Load forecasting; Multi energy; Electric power plant loads; Topology; Graph structures; Multilevels; Electric load forecasting; Multi tasks; Integrated energy systems; matrix; Integrated energy system; Multi-energy load; Multi-energy loads; Balancing; Multi-task balance; Task sharing; #forecasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address these challenges, this work presents a novel FD framework that integrates a Relational Bi-level Aggregation Graph Convolutional Network (RBAGCN) with Red Panda Optimization (RPO). Initially, the data are collected from the US electric power TLs dataset. Afterward, the data are fed to pre-processing.

However, these systems are increasingly being targeted by cyberattackers, posing significant risks to grid stability and security. Existing security solutions focus on either attack detection by verifying their signatures or predicting their cascading failure to isolate the failed component from the rest of the working components. In the current paper, our objective is to detect new or existing attacks and predict their cascading failure. This research accomplish the objective by introducing a new multi-model framework that combines three models, XGBoost, Transformer, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), to identify both known and unknown cyberattacks with forecast their cascading impacts on power grid systems. The XGBoost model detects the known attack patterns, which includes Data Injection, Remote Tripping Command Injection, Relay Setting Change Attacks. The Transformer model identifies the deviations from established attack patterns, which result in the discovery of new threats. Our evaluation of grid infrastructure attacks utilizes a GNN-based cascading failure prediction model that represents the power grid as a graph to forecast failure propagation through interconnected nodes. Through rigorous testing using an real world dataset, our framework shows exceptional detection performance while maintaining effective generalization to new attacks and strong cascading failure prediction capabilities.

However, this integration can introduce power quality (PQ) issues due to unbalanced, critical, and nonlinear load conditions. This manuscript proposes a novel approach for improving PQ in HRES through the integration of a Hiking Optimization Algorithm (HOA) and a Spike-Induced Graph Neural Network (SIGNN), referred to as the HOA–SIGNN method. The primary objective is to mitigate the effects of nonlinear, unbalanced, and critical load conditions by optimizing the 2DOF-PIDF (Two-Degree-of-Freedom Proportional–Integral–Derivative with Filter) controller parameters, ensuring superior PQ management. Unlike conventional methods, HOA leverages Tobler’s Hiking Function to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation, achieving faster convergence and reducing computational complexity. SIGNN further enhances system adaptability by capturing spatial–temporal dependencies using its temporal activation mechanism, leading to accurate gain parameter estimation. The proposed technique is excluded in MATLAB and compared with other strategies that have already been used, like Puzzle Optimization Algorithm, Artificial Neural Network, and Cuckoo Search Optimization. Results demonstrate that the HOA–SIGNN technique achieves an extremely low Total Harmonic Distortion of 0.12% and reduces computational time to 483 ms while maintaining an efficiency of 98.74% and minimizing the Integral Square Error to 0.01%.

These outages disrupt economic activity and impact energy efficiency and sustainability goals by necessitating less efficient backup generation and hindering the integration of renewable energy sources. This paper introduces a pioneering, explainable Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for edge-level transmission line failure prediction, addressing a critical gap in grid resilience analytics. Our work presents two key innovations: first, it is the first framework of its kind to be systematically validated across four standard power grid benchmarks (IEEE-24, 39, 118, and the UK grid), demonstrating robust generalization. Second, it advances an interdisciplinary approach by uniquely integrating network science principles with deep learning, augmenting traditional electrical data with topological descriptors like betweenness centrality and load ratio. This fusion enhances the predictive power of three GNN architectures: GINE, GAT, and EdgeAwareGC. On the IEEE-24 test system, this integration boosts macro-F1 scores from 0.498 to 0.871 for EdgeAwareGC and from 0.335 to 0.859 for GINE. This scalability and effectiveness are further demonstrated on the highly imbalanced IEEE-118 network, where EdgeAwareGC achieves a strong F1 score of 0.553. Explainability techniques such as gradient-based attribution and GNNExplainer uncover key physical and topological predictors, providing actionable guidance for grid operators. Our findings inform grid modernization policies, supporting initiatives like the U.S. Department of Energy's Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) program.

A thorough analysis of machine learning (ML) techniques for wind power prediction is presented in this research, encompassing advancements from 2006 to 2025. Physical, statistical, traditional machine learning, deep learning, ensemble, and hybrid models are the categories into which current forecasting techniques fall. With particular focus on sophisticated designs like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and hybrid CNN–LSTM frameworks, we examine their capabilities, constraints, and application domains. The paper also looks at lightweight solutions that allow deployment on low-cost edge devices, as well as optimization algorithms like the Fruit Fly Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Comparative analyses show how well various models handle temporal dependencies, nonlinearity, scalability, and interpretability over a range of predicting horizons.

In light of these developments, we introduce the Probabilistic Dual-Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (DAS-GCN).

This dual approach enables comprehensive and enhanced data analysis by facilitating the learning of charging network and node connectivity, allowing for accurate forecasting of complex EV charging demands.

However, it is difficult to clarify the correlation between wind farms in the power prediction of WFC, which leads to the difficulty of stable and accurate prediction. Therefore, this paper proposes a short-term power prediction method for WFC considering wind power cumulative effect (CE) and temporal causality (TC). Firstly, the two relationships (CE and TC) between wind farms are clarified and used to construct an adjacency matrix separately, then the error characteristics (EC) are used to form an adjacency matrix as well. Secondly, the adjacency matrix information with different attributes is fused by the multi-channel attention mechanism to obtain the wind power prediction results. Finally, the proposed method is applied to three WFCs in China, by which the universality and effectiveness of the method is verified.

To protect critical power infrastructure, there is an urgent need for an advanced intrusion detection system capable of capturing the intricate interactions within smart grids. Although traditional graph neural network (GNN)-based methods have exhibited substantial potential, they primarily rely on network data (e.g., IP addresses and ports) to construct the graph structure, failing to adequately integrate physical data from power grid devices. Moreover, these methods typically employ fixed activation functions in downstream deep networks, which limits the accurate representation of complex nonlinear attack patterns, thereby reducing detection accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper introduces GraphKAN, a novel intrusion detection framework that leverages graph attention network (GAT) and Kolmogorov–Arnold network (KAN) to enhance detection precision in smart grids. GraphKAN firstly constructs a graph-structured representation with power devices, information technology devices, and communication network devices as nodes, and integrates the physical connections and logical dependencies among infrastructure elements as edges, providing a comprehensive view of device interactions. Furthermore, the GAT module utilizes multi-head attention mechanisms to dynamically allocate node weights, extracting global features that encompass both feature information and interaction patterns. The KAN introduces learnable activation functions based on parameterized B-splines, enhancing the nonlinear expression of the global features extracted by GAT and significantly improving the detection accuracy of complex attack patterns. Experiments conducted on datasets obtained from Mississippi State University and Oak Ridge National Laboratory demonstrate that GraphKAN achieves detection accuracies of 97.63%, 98.66%, and 99.04% for binary, ternary, and 37-class intrusion detection tasks, respectively. These results represent substantial improvements over state-of-the-art models, including GA-RBF-SVM, BGWO-EC, and Net_Stack, with accuracy gains of 5.73%, 0.89%, and 3.52%, respectively. The findings underscore the efficacy of GraphKAN in enhancing intrusion detection accuracy in smart grids and its robust performance in complex attack scenarios. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:43","2025-11-25 21:48:19","","","","1","15","","Sci.

However, the intricate interdependencies among different energy sources and their varying sampling frequencies pose significant challenges for accurate forecasting. Existing studies often overlook the complex cross-energy relationships and the multitime-scale nature of energy consumption data. To address these challenges, we introduce a multiscale time-aware graph mamba neural network-based model (MSTAGMN), a novel approach for forecasting electricity consumption, gas consumption and water consumption, which have different sampling rates. Specifically, we employ a time-aware self-attention message-passing mechanism to learn the relationship between multivariate time series sampled at different time intervals. The information propagated from observed sensors is dependent on edges in the time-varying graph G to neighboring sensors. Furthermore, we leverage mamba structure to capture temporal attention weights to aggregate sensor’s embedding. In addition, we incorporate uncertainty quantification via log-variance prediction, which enables the model to quantify aleatoric uncertainty. This adaptive mechanism improves predictive accuracy by adjusting forecasts based on input variability. Experiments on the UNICON dataset confirm that MSTAGMN outperforms state-of-the-art models in forecasting irregular time series. Specifically, MSTAGMN reduces quantile loss by 6.03% for water consumption, 7.53% for gas consumption, and 4.02% for electricity consumption compared to the leading model. These results demonstrate MSTAGMN’s superior accuracy and enhanced uncertainty estimation in multienergy system forecasting. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:43","2025-11-25 14:02:42","","872-882","","3","19","","IEEE Syst.

First, a graph convolutional network is employed to model the spatial correlations in PV generation data. Then, a multi-level attention unit incorporating contextual attention mechanisms is designed as the basic module of a gated recurrent unit (GRU) network to capture the global temporal dependencies of PV data. Furthermore, a time decoupling unit is inserted between GRU layers to decompose the PV generation sequences into transient fluctuations and trend components, enabling multi-scale feature perception. Finally, a high speed channel is introduced to optimize the gradient backpropagation path. Experiments are conducted on real world PV generation datasets for power forecasting tasks, with model performance evaluated using mean absolute error, mean squared error, root mean squared error, and R-square (R2) metrics.

Current deep learning approaches to solving the FDIA localization problem for smart grids frequently ignore the global spatial dependencies, failing to model dependencies between nonadjacent nodes and consequently compromising localization precision. Additionally, the computational complexity of deep learning architectures compromises localization interpretability, diminishing the credibility of results. To address the above challenges, we propose an interpretable deep learning-based FDIA localization method that leverages the multi-head graph convolutional attention network. Unlike prior approaches focusing solely on local spatial dependencies within power grids, the proposed method integrates multi-head graph attention into Chebyshev graph convolution, simultaneously capturing both local and global spatial dependencies. Specifically, each attention head learns distinct spatial dependencies within independent subspaces, which are then dynamically aggregated to capture both global and local spatial relationships, thereby improving localization precision. Furthermore, the model offers receivable interpretations for precise localization outcomes by revealing the model’s focus on various spatial nodes during the decision-making process. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus test systems. Simulation results reveal that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in localization precision, demonstrating precision improvements of 1.06% and 4.31% for the 14-bus and 118-bus systems, respectively, while providing reasonable interpretability for spatial dependencies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:43","2025-11-25 16:21:59","","","","15","81","","J Supercomput","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Springer","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/3AV6LES9/Chen et al. - 2025 - Interpretable localization of false data injection attacks in smart grids a multi-head graph convol.pdf","","#done; Smart grid; Deep learning; Network security; Attention mechanisms; Interpretability; Convolution; False data injection attacks; Smart power grids; Localisation; Cyber security; Decision making; Spatial dependencies; Behavioral research; Attack localization; Interpretable deep learning; Multi-head graph attention mechanism; #cybersecurity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The dynamic and complex structure of modern power networks makes it difficult to manage and improve energy efficiency, especially in the era of renewable integration. Imbalances in energy supply and demand can lead to system instability, including voltage drops, spikes, and outages. Additionally, ongoing power system reforms have increased the complexity of forecasting grid development and operational requirements. To address these challenges, intelligent energy management and optimization systems are essential for preventing bottlenecks and maintaining supply-demand equilibrium. Regardless of climatic variations, such systems must deliver reliable, cost-effective energy services while enabling energy sharing across the grid. This study introduces a deep learning-based framework, the spatiotemporal adaptive energy optimization network (SAEON), designed to enhance real-time energy management. SAEON integrates graph neural networks and long short-term memory to model both spatial and temporal dependencies in grid data. It includes three core components: A spatiotemporal data collection module that captures temporal trends and spatial relationships; an optimization module using deep reinforcement learning to determine optimal energy load allocation strategies; and an adaptive feedback mechanism that continuously fine-tunes model parameters during operation. Experimental results demonstrate that SAEON can significantly reduce energy costs, improve efficiency, minimize losses, and enhance load balancing.

Existing methods often struggle to fully capture the intricate temporal complexities and inter-variable dependencies present in multivariate time-series data. To address this, we propose a multi-scale temporal channel features fusion-based method for multi-energy load prediction. Firstly, we introduce a Dynamic Channel Weighted Strategy, which adaptively reconstructs intrinsic mode functions derived from Variational Mode Decomposition, reducing the number of channels and computational costs while retaining essential features. Secondly, we develop an Adaptive Channel Fusion LSTM (ACF-LSTM) by integrating learnable graph neural networks and graph convolution operations into traditional LSTM cells, enabling effective modeling of channel correlations in multivariate time series. By modeling multi-energy load data from dual perspectives using the ACF-LSTM, we construct a Temporal-Channel Feature Fusion (TCFF) block that combines both time and frequency domains for comprehensive feature extraction. A learnable frequency selection mechanism within the TCFF block adaptively identifies relevant frequency components, enhancing the model's ability to capture periodic patterns and long-term dependencies.

Microgrids offer resilience, enhanced energy efficiency, and improved integration of renewable resources compared to centralized energy systems, enabling localized energy management and reduced reliance on fossil fuels. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown its potential for microgrid energy optimization by enabling intelligent, adaptive control over energy resources and energy exchange. By learning from interactions with the environment, the DRL agent dynamically adjusts the power outputs of distributed energy resources, manages energy storage systems, and balances energy exchange between microgrid elements and with the main grid, aiming to minimize costs and ensure reliable power availability. However, incorporating spatial relationships into DRL action space significantly increases computational demands. In line with this, we have introduced a novel method that integrates DRL, Graph Neural Network (GNN) and dynamic clustering to optimize microgrid operations. GNNs are specialized deep learning models that adapt to graphs of varying sizes and structures. This adaptability enables GNN-equipped DRL agents to effectively learn from and apply knowledge to a wide range of network topologies. The agent can be used for subsets, or sub-microgrids, taking into account the scalability and efficiency of the optimization process, enabling distance and routing optimization without an aggregated model.

Although data-based ELS methods have shown remarkable results, these methods are developed based on the assumption that there is no missing data and no occurrence of new faults during online applications, which is unrealistic.

This paper proposes a novel multitask active transfer learning-based LS framework to overcome these limitations. The multitask learning framework enables the model to handle the optimal LS and missing data imputation tasks simultaneously. The problem of performing these tasks as discrete and individual learning objectives, which lacks optimization to exploit the available data fully, is effectively addressed through the multitask learning approach. The conditional tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN) algorithm, an unsupervised deep learning technique based on two contesting deep neural networks, is used to complete the missing data. In addition, a hybrid graph convolutional network (GCN)-Transformer model is proposed within an integrated framework for optimal load shedding, which enhances performance by capturing both local features and long-range dependencies among power system buses. Using a small dataset, this paper employs active transfer learning to adapt a pre-trained GCN-Transformer model to a previously unseen but related fault scenario. This strategy addresses the critical challenge of handling unseen faults in power systems. By leveraging active learning, the model selectively queries the most informative samples, reducing the labeled data required for effective adaptation and significantly shortening the model update time. The results of implementing the proposed model on an IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate its effective performance in completing missing data and enhancing the model's robustness when unseen faults occur. The findings from the results provide valuable technical support for the practical application of DL-based LS in transient stability control for real-world power systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:44","2025-11-26 09:22:22","","","","","27","","Result.

Existing power flow optimization methods cannot fully adapt to changing network topologies. At the same time, traditional load forecasting technologies have limited accuracy in coping with extreme weather and behavioral uncertainties, which has become a bottleneck restricting the safe and economic operation of the power grid and the consumption of new energy. Aiming at this core challenge, this study deeply integrates artificial intelligence technology and grid physical characteristics to propose an innovative topology-aware smart grid optimization framework. The framework uses a dynamic graph neural network (GNN) to identify and learn the complex physical connection relationships of the power grid in real time and accurately represent the deep-seated impact of topological changes on power flow distribution. At the same time, the long-term and short-term memory network (LSTM) based on the spatio-temporal attention mechanism deeply mines the correlation between massive historical operating data and multi-meteorological information to achieve high-precision short-term load forecasting. It uses a joint training mechanism to seamlessly embed the forecast results into topology awareness. The power flow optimization model builds a collaborative, interactive closed loop. Large-scale simulation verification on IEEE 118-node system shows that the proposed model has made a significant breakthrough in load forecasting, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) as low as 1.53 %, which is 65 % lower than the traditional LSTM model prediction error (4.32 %); Under the scenario of topology dynamic change, the developed optimization strategy can reduce the average transmission network loss by 14.6 %, shorten the optimization solution time by 62.1 %, and significantly reduce the incidence of voltage exceeding the limit accident by 82.1 %. What is particularly outstanding is that in the face of topology reorganization caused by sudden line failure, the system automatically completes re-optimization within 200 milliseconds, demonstrating strong real-time response and robust adaptability. This study provides solid theoretical support and a practical technical path for building a safer, more efficient, self-healing smart grid. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:44","2025-11-25 21:15:37","","","","","218","","Microchem.

Exploiting the spatio-temporal dependencies at multiple wind farm sites within the target region can significantly enhance the forecasting performance. However, multitudes of wind farms pose ignorable modelling challenges due to the intricate correlations arising from the continuity of different spatial-scale weather systems, and traditional loss function based on mean square error manifests natural weaknesses in the face of extreme events. To tackle these issues and further boost the forecasting accuracy, this paper constructs a hierarchical spatio-temporal graph neural network with a correction module and an improved loss function grounded in extreme value theory. Sub-regions are first divided based on agglomerative hierarchical clustering considering geographic distance information and long-term climate characteristics. Then, the hierarchical spatio-temporal forecasting framework consisting of graph neural network and redesigned bidirectional long-short term memory network is established to address the multifaceted interconnections across the wind farms and sub-regions. In addition, the correction module and corresponding revised loss function are encapsulated to enhance the forecasting performance at certain moments especially with extreme values.

Artificial intelligence offers promising solutions to achieve this, especially for real-time decision-making. This article presents a novel approach for the automatic reconfiguration of shipboard power networks using graph-based reinforcement learning (RL). We modeled the medium voltage direct current (MVDC) shipboard power network reconfiguration problem as a markov decision process, utilizing deep Q-learning to determine the optimal network control policy. The RL policy network is designed using a graph convolutional network (GCN). This technique optimizes the optimal status (ON/OFF) of switches in the MVDC shipboard power network, ensuring maximum power availability to loads during disruptive events such as network faults. The developed method is validated on a four-zone MVDC shipboard power network, demonstrating its effectiveness in autonomously and efficiently managing power distribution. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI)-driven approaches, shipboard power networks can achieve adaptive and intelligent reconfiguration, enhancing resilience, reducing response times, and mitigating the cascading risks associated with manual intervention.

Indeed, GNNs are excellent models of spatiotemporal dependencies in power networks, as concerns reasonably accurate voltage control riding on topologies themselves. Together with these factors, MARL leaves open decentralized and cooperative decision-making, which runs into adjustments for swaying voltages. The results of the simulations yielded 42 % less than average voltage deviations, a deterioration of 17 %, reduced the losses of the system, and a 30 % speed-up for standard optimization techniques. The test of the algorithms was executed under MATLAB with a Python-based grid simulation environment to affirm its real-world applicability and scalability.

However, the inherently stochastic and instantaneous nature of wind power generation presents significant challenges for forecasting models, particularly in capturing abrupt fluctuations in wind patterns. To address these challenges, this study proposes a data-physical hybrid model ultra-short-term wind power forecasting method that integrates spatial and temporal correlations. A dynamic model switching mechanism is introduced, activated by a predefined wind speed mutation threshold to transition between models. Under stable conditions, a data-driven model is employed, utilizing a graph learning layer to construct a spatiotemporal representation of wind power sequences. This structure enables the extraction of global spatial dependencies through a double-layer graph neural network architecture. Conversely, when wind speed fluctuations exceed the mutation threshold, a hybrid model incorporating both physical principles and data-driven methods is activated to enhance forecasting accuracy. Additionally, a stacking ensemble learning framework is integrated to further improve model robustness and stability.

Consequently, optimal power flow (OPF) with SSS constraints is becoming increasingly important for maintaining both the economic and stability performance of power system operation. However, the time efficiency and performance of current SSSC-OPF methods may be heavily impacted by varying load conditions and changing topologies in large-scale renewable power systems. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces a novel strategy termed domain-adversarial-neural-network to address the SSSC-OPF problem under varying load or topology operating conditions. The proposed method allows the model trained on sufficient labeled data in the source domain (basic operating condition) to be effectively applied to the limited unlabeled data in the target domain (load/topology changes). Additionally, distinct constraints for low-frequency and subsynchronous oscillations ensure dynamic stability. Moreover, to improve the performance of the proposed method in processing graph-structured power system data, an edge-aggregated graph attention neural network is employed to extract spatial features.

With the rapid expansion of grid infrastructure and increasing sophistication of cyber threats, existing manual alarm-tracing methods face significant challenges in handling the massive volume of security alerts, leading to delayed responses and potential system vulnerabilities. Current approaches often lack the capability to effectively model complex relationships among alerts and are hindered by imbalanced data distributions, which degrade tracing accuracy. To this end, this paper proposes a power monitor system cybersecurity alarm-tracing method based on the knowledge graph (KG) and graph convolutional neural networks (GCNN). Specifically, a cybersecurity KG is constituted based on the historical alert, accurately representing the entities and relationships in massive alerts. Then, a GCNN with attention mechanisms is applied to sufficiently extract the topological features along alarms in KG so that it can precisely and effectively trace the massive alarms. Most importantly, to mitigate the influence of imbalanced alarms for tracing, a specialized data process and model ensemble strategy by adaptively weighted imbalance sample is proposed. Finally, based on 70,000 alarm information from a regional power grid, by applying the method proposed in this paper, an alarm traceability accuracy rate of 96.59% was achieved.

A cross-modal attention mechanism further models fine-grained interactions between input measurements and node/edge attributes, enabling the capture of nonlinear correlations essential for accurate state estimation. To ensure physical feasibility, soft power-flow residuals are incorporated into training as a physics-constrained regularization, guiding predictions toward consistency with grid operation. Extensive studies on IEEE/CIGRE 14-, 70-, and 179-bus systems show that the proposed method surpasses conventional weighted least squares and representative neural baselines in accuracy, convergence speed, and computational efficiency while exhibiting strong robustness to measurement noise and topological uncertainty. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:44","2025-11-25 14:02:46","","","","10","13","","Process.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/B7IJZIGB/Liu et al. - 2025 - Robust Distribution System State Estimation with Physics-Constrained Heterogeneous Graph Embedding a.pdf","","#done; Graph neural networks; Network topology; graph neural network; Deep learning; Power flows; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission networks; deep learning; Heterogeneous graph; State estimation; Embeddings; state estimation; Uncertainty analysis; Graph embeddings; Heterogeneous networks; Least squares approximations; Distribution system state estimations; Topology changes; power flow; Spurious signal noise; Cross-modal; Real time distribution; Topology measurements; #grid-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accurately predicting multivariate time series is challenging due to the complex temporal and spatial dependencies among variables. To tackle this challenge, this study proposed a deep learning model utilizing graph neural networks for predicting multivariate time series. Specifically, a multivariate time series is modeled as a graph, with nodes representing variables, edges indicating their interdependencies, and the time series data serving as node attributes. We leverage the temporal convolutional network to construct a graph structure learning module that captures the underlying dependencies between variables through the learned adjacency matrix. The prediction model was built by integrating Long Short-Term Memory networks and graph neural networks, enabling the simultaneous capture of temporal and spatial dependencies in multivariate time series data. Additionally, to mitigate the issue of over-smoothing in graph neural networks, we incorporated the Laplacian sharpening technique into our model. The proposed method is generalizable for handling multivariate time series data, as it does not require a pre-defined adjacency matrix among variables. We empirically evaluated the performance of our method through extensive experiments conducted on six real-world datasets, the experimental results indicated that our method could effectively improve the accuracy of multivariate time series prediction. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:44","2025-11-25 16:21:18","","","","","141","","Eng Appl Artif Intell","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/TR2WL69T/Lei et al. - 2025 - A novel spatial–temporal graph convolution network based on temporal embedding graph structure learn.pdf","","#done; Convolutional neural networks; Graph neural networks; Multivariate time series; Prediction models; Graph structures; Time-series data; Graph embeddings; Graph structure learning; Structure-learning; Temporal and spatial; Time series prediction; Laplacian sharpening; Laplacians; #forecasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To overcome the black-box nature inherent in conventional artificial intelligence methods, this work explicitly models identifiable manifestations of physical constraints through interpretable graph neural network (GNN) layers. Consequently, this paper develops a data-driven and physics-model-fused diagnostic approach: the topology-aware graph neural network (TAGNN). A dual diagnostic strategy based on DC-side harmonic injection and AC-side voltage sensitivity is proposed. This establishes explicit mappings between topological characteristics and power flow feasible regions, thereby revealing the intrinsic relationship between grid topological structures and unsolvable power flow conditions. The approach addresses the challenge of solving multivariate nonlinear equations within coupled AC-DC Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems. The simulation experiments, designed to replicate grid fault scenarios, demonstrate the superior performance enhancement achieved by integrating the topology attention layer with the gated recurrent unit within the TAGNN framework. Compared against the current mainstream benchmark methods, the proposed model yields an average improvement exceeding 10% across key test metrics.

GPIAN replaces conventional attention mechanism with a complex network-based framework, where the Electric Functional Strength (EFS), a metric quantifying node interaction guided by power grid principles, drives adaptive information aggregation. This design not only reduces model parameters by 90.7% compared to standard graph attention network but also embeds physical interpretability, enabling the model to prioritize critical node-edge dependencies in cascading failure scenarios. Experimental validation across IEEE-39, IEEE-118, IEEE-300, and Italian power grids demonstrates that GPIAN achieves higher prediction accuracy than mainstream methods, while maintaining fast inference speeds suitable for real-time deployment.

To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a physics-aware deep learning-embedded model predictive control (MPC) approach to enable deeply flexible commercial building HVAC system control for demand response. Firstly, the chiller's operational characteristic is captured via a deep learning model with high approximation capability, integrated with a physics-constrained block to enforce operational constraints. The multi-zone thermal dynamics are modeled using a graph convolutional network informed by the prior building structure. Secondly, the proposed deep learning models are equivalently reformulated into mixed integer linear constraints and seamlessly embedded into the MPC framework. To enhance the solution efficiency, the bound forward propagation algorithm and network pruning techniques are both developed for the deep learning-embedded MPC approach.

A residential grid, it consists of multiple homes, each with different members and behavioral attributes. The demand side management strategies implemented on a residential grid modify the electricity consumption behavior in order to maintain an equilibrium between demand and supply of electricity. The consumers in return receive several incentives that further motivate them to participate in such programs. Due to the diverse consumer set involved in DSM operations, providing incentives can be challenging and costly for utilities to manage. Also, the DSM operations run at the risk of failure when the consumers opt out from the program because their comfort is compromised as a result of the load shift. In this regard, this paper aims to classify the consumers based on their suitability for DSM operations. Based on the historic consumption behavior of the consumers, the proposed classification framework finds potential targets who can help in a significant amount of load reduction as a result of DSM operations. The framework creates a graph structure from the historic load consumption data of each residential home which is then used to train the GCN classifier model to classify the residential home for their suitability. The DSM-GCN framework is trained on Ireland residential grid with half hourly electricity consumption data of more than an year.

However, transformers work in complex environments such as high noise and strong magnetic interference for a long time, resulting in problems such as multiple types of faults, difficulty in extracting fault characteristics, and low accuracy in fault diagnosis. Based on this, this article proposes a fault diagnosis method based on adaptive local iterative filtering (ALIF)-fuzzy dispersion entropy (FDE)-adaptive wavelet threshold filtering and improved graph neural networks (GNNs). Firstly, ALIF is used to perform modal decomposition on the original signal, and FDE is employed to eliminate noise-dominant modes and extract optimal voltage sample feature vectors. Secondly, an adaptive wavelet threshold function based on FDE features is proposed to suppress residual noise. By dynamically adjusting parameters, it synchronously suppresses excessive high-frequency smoothing and pseudo-Gibbs phenomenon, achieving noise suppression and feature fidelity of the signal. Finally, a multi-layer bridged high-order GNN integrating dynamic attention mechanisms and contrastive normalization is constructed. This network enhances the ability to capture long-range dependencies in voltage signals through hierarchical feature aggregation. Experimental results show that the fault diagnosis algorithm proposed in this paper exhibits high noise robustness and diagnostic accuracy. Compared to fixed threshold functions and traditional GNNs, it improves the signal-to-noise ratio by 6.4%, reduces the mean squared error by 42.5%, increases the diagnostic accuracy by 2.61%, and enhances the F1 score by 3.60%, achieving high-precision fault diagnosis for voltage transformers. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:45","2025-11-25 14:02:53","","","","8","36","","Meas.

However, the complexity introduced by diverse energy conversions and spatiotemporal coupling in MRIES poses significant challenges for energy management. This paper introduces a novel low-carbon energy management framework (EMF) for multi-regional IES, based on spatiotemporal correlations and considering three-dimensional (3D) integrated demand-side response (IDR). The proposed framework employs a novel Cross-Gated Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (CGSTG) to achieve high-precision joint power forecasting separately for the RDG and multi-type loads. In the day-ahead stage, 3D IDR involving flexible loads, e.g., EVs, is considered with multi-regional IES sharing electricity and heat. By engaging in IDR across the temporal (horizontal), spatial (depth), and energy conversion (vertical) dimensions, each IES can enhance its coordinated scheduling capability and operational economy. During the intra-day stage, rolling optimization is performed based on the model predictive control (MPC) framework, incorporating a ladder-type carbon trading mechanism (CTM). Comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively reduce operational costs and carbon emissions with significant improvement of coordinated scheduling capability, leading to economic and environmental benefits of MRIES. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-17 18:58:45","2025-11-26 09:23:03","","","","","235","","Renew.

These failures, due to their propagation through the cyber and physical networks, often lead to severe disruptions. We employ improved percolation theory to model cascading failures triggered by malware cyber-attacks. Addressing the vulnerability of CPPS requires a comprehensive analysis that spans both the structural and functional dimensions of CPPS. This paper introduces a novel framework for vulnerability assessment in CPPS using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). Our approach captures the topological complexities and dynamic characteristics of CPPS, incorporating the entropy of potential energy of power system as a new feature to predict and analyze failure propagation. Through Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), we subsequently quantify the influence of potential energy on system vulnerabilities. Critical components are identified by using LRP scores and an entropy weighting method (EWM). Simulation results based on the cyber–physical IEEE 39-bus and IEEE RTS-96 power systems as test cases, demonstrate the model's efficacy in identifying vulnerable nodes and branches and highlight the significant role of potential energy in cascading failures.

False data injection attack (FDIA) is one of the attack classes that targets smart measurement devices by injecting malicious data. Machine learning techniques are proven to be effective in detecting and localizing FDIAs. Training of such models requires centralized processing of sensitive user data that may not be plausible in a practical scenario. By employing federated learning, it is possible to train a model for the detection and localization of FDIAs while preserving the privacy of sensitive user data. However, federated learning introduces new problems, such as the personalization of the detectors in each node.

Accurately assessing EV charging demand becomes crucial for maintaining MES stability, making it an urgent issue to be studied. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel deep learning-based EV charging load prediction framework to assess the impact of EVs on the MES. First, to model the EV traffic flow, a modified weight fusion spatial–temporal graph convolutional network (WSTGCN) is proposed to capture the inherent spatial–temporal characteristics of traffic flow. Specifically, to enhance the WSTGCN performance, the modified residual modules and weight fusion mechanism are integrated into the WSTGCN. Then, based on the predicted traffic flow, an improved queuing theory model is introduced to predict the charging load. In this improved queuing theory model, special consideration is given to subjective EV user behaviors, such as refusing to join queues and leaving impatiently, making the queuing model more realistic. Additionally, it should be noted that the proposed charging load predicting method relies on traffic flow data rather than historical charging data, which successfully addresses the data insufficiency problem of newly established charging stations, thereby offering significant practical value. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed WSTGCN model exhibits superior accuracy in predicting traffic flow compared to other benchmark models, and the improved queuing theory model further enhances the accuracy of the results. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-17 18:58:45","2025-11-25 16:21:18","","","","19","17","","Energies","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/CRYZHZJL/Zhang et al. - 2024 - Electric Vehicle Charging Load Prediction Based on Weight Fusion Spatial–Temporal Graph Convolutiona.pdf","","#done; Convolutional networks; Deep learning; Prediction models; Spatial temporals; Temporal graphs; deep learning; Electric load forecasting; Queueing networks; Load predictions; Charging loads; charging load prediction; Charging load prediction; Queueing theory; spatial–temporal network; Spatial–temporal network; Temporal networks; weight fusion; Weight fusion; #forecasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sampling-based risk quantification allows explicit computation of the risk associated with a given probabilistic forecast of power demand and supply. However, it requires solving a large number of optimization (DC OPF) problems within a short time, which is computationally demanding. The computational burden is alleviated by developing graph neural network (GNN) surrogates, because GNNs are especially suitable for modeling graph-structured data. In contrast to previous works that developed GNN surrogates to predict bus-level (generator dispatch) decisions or line flow, the proposed GNN models directly predict zonal/system level quantities needed for grid risk assessment. That is, in addition to generator dispatch and line flow, we develop GNN models that directly predict zonal or system level reserve shortage and load shedding. The benefits of these GNN surrogates are demonstrated using four synthetic grids (Case118, Case300, Case1354pegase, and Case2848rte). It is shown that the proposed GNN surrogates are 250–800 times faster than numerical solvers at predicting the grid state, and they enable fast as well as accurate risk quantification for power grids. It is also shown that directly predicting aggregated zonal/system level quantities leads to more accurate predictions than aggregating bus level predictions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:45","2025-11-25 14:02:53","","","","","43","","Sustain.

Hence, this research introduces a novel residual GCN with attention mechanism for mapping critical energy infrastructure components in geographic contexts. The proposed model accurately predicts the geographic locations and links of large-scale grid infrastructure, such as poles, electricity service points, and substations. The proposed framework is assessed on the Sultanate of Oman's regional energy grid and further validated on Nigeria's electricity transmission network database. The obtained findings showcase the model's capacity to accurately predict infrastructure components and their spatial relationships. Results show that the proposed method achieves a link-prediction accuracy of 95.88% for the Omani network and 92.98% for the Nigerian dataset. Furthermore, the proposed model achieved R2 values of 0.99 for both datasets in terms of regression. Therefore, the proposed architecture facilitates multifaceted assessment and enhances the capacity to capture the inherent geospatial aspects of large-scale energy distribution networks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:45","2025-11-25 21:57:30","","","","","20","","Energy.

These features enhance grid reliability and support the seamless integration of large-scale EVs into power grids. However, the unpredictable frequency of charging sessions creates challenges such as voltage fluctuations and grid imbalances, adversely affecting power quality (PQ) and stability. To address these issues, this study proposes a hybrid approach for AP and RP control in three-phase grid-connected EVs. The novel ZOA-MASTGNN technique integrates the Zebra Optimization Algorithm (ZOA) with the Multimodal Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (MASTGNN). The ZOA dynamically optimizes system parameters, improving power management, reducing Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), and enhancing grid stability. Meanwhile, MASTGNN predicts optimal control actions, mitigating harmonics, regulating voltage dynamically, and adapting to changing operational conditions in grid-interactive EV systems. The suggested method was implemented on the MATLAB platform and evaluated with existing approaches, including Resiliency-Guided Physics-Informed Neural Networks (RPINN), Elman Neural Networks (ENN), Multilayer Feed Forward Neural Networks (ML-FFNN), Deep Neural Networks (DNN), and Particle Swarm Optimization-Artificial Neural Networks (PSO-ANN).

However, the black-box nature makes deep learning models generally difficult to interpret. In order to compensate for the poor interpretability of deep learning models, this study proposed a fault diagnosis method based on interpretable graph neural network (GNN) suitable for building energy systems. The method is developed by following three main steps: (1) selecting NC-GNN as a fault diagnosis model for building energy systems and proposing a graph generation method applicable to the model, (2) developing an interpretation method based on InputXGradient for the NC-GNN, which is capable of outputting the importance of the node features and automatically locating the fault related features, (3) visualizing the results of model interpretation and validating by matching with expert knowledge and maintenance experience. Validation was performed using the public ASHRAE RP-1043 chiller fault data. The diagnosis results show that the proposed method has a diagnosis accuracy of over 96%. The interpretation results show that the method is capable of explaining the decision-making process of the model by identifying fault-discriminative features.

Pre-fault DSA methods that utilize deep learning techniques have been successfully implemented and have shown promising results. However, these methods face challenges in real power systems, such as unknown faults and the increasing integration of power electronics-based units. Adding these units changes the system dynamics and introduces new stability problems, such as the loss of synchronism that current methods cannot analyze. In practical applications, new faults may arise that are not present in the training database, which can decrease the accuracy of the online DSA model. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces a new dynamic security index that considers the effects of loss of synchronism in power electronics-based units on DSA. Also, a graph convolutional network (GCN)-based model is developed to improve DSA accuracy by incorporating the topological information of the power system in the form of an adjacency matrix. To address the issue of unknown faults, this paper uses transfer learning based on full fine-tuning to adapt a pre-trained GCN model to a different but related unknown fault. This approach eliminates the need for a large number of labeled examples for new faults and ensures efficient transfer of the model to new faults with a small database. Case studies are conducted on a modified IEEE 39-bus system to investigate the impact of power electronics-based units' penetration on dynamic security and the model's ability to transfer knowledge for unknown faults. The results from various evaluation indicators demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:45","2025-11-25 14:02:53","","","","","12","","e-Prime - Adv.

However, recent works have primarily focused on designing complex model structures, often overlooking computational efficiency or the balance between efficiency and prediction accuracy, which limits practical applications. This paper aims to improve data quality, reduce computational cost, and enhance prediction accuracy by proposing a spatiotemporal prediction method for large-scale wind farms. To address the parameter sensitivity issue of the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and to enhance its anomaly detection capability and robustness, we propose an improved version of DBSCAN, applied to wind turbine data anomaly detection. Simultaneously, leveraging the high-performance advantage of the lightweight gradient boosting machine, abnormal data are quickly corrected. Using spectral clustering based on graph theory, we optimally partition the data graph to form wind farm clusters. Subsequently, a two-layer adaptive graph convolutional recurrent neural network (AGCRN) is employed to capture complex spatiotemporal correlations between wind turbines in each cluster. Finally, the regional total power forecast is obtained by summing the forecast outputs of all clusters. Through numerical simulations using measured data from Dataset 1 (134 wind turbines) and Dataset 2 (200 wind turbines), the results indicate that the proposed data preprocessing scheme can achieve at least a 50 % improvement in the model. By forecasting in clusters, the mean absolute error (MAE) can be reduced by 45.84 %, training time shortened by 70.84 %, and GPU memory saved by 94.04 %. Compared with advanced models such as Transformer variants and TimeNet, the multi-layer AGCRN achieves the highest prediction accuracy, exceeding 85 %. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:45","2025-11-25 14:02:42","","","","","65","","Adv.

This paper introduces a multi-objective graph-based reinforcement learning (MO-GRL) framework that optimally manages energy storage systems (ESS) to enhance voltage stability, provide synthetic inertia for frequency support, and maximize energy efficiency. The proposed model integrates Koopman operator theory for predictive ESS dynamics, graph neural networks for learning spatial relationships in power networks, and soft actor-critic reinforcement learning for multi-objective optimization. Furthermore, a Lyapunov-based stability constraint is incorporated to ensure the robustness of voltage and frequency control policies under uncertain conditions. Compared to conventional techniques, MO-GRL dynamically adjusts control policies based on real-time grid states, offering improved adaptability. Simulations on an IEEE 33-bus test system demonstrate significant improvements, including a 42% reduction in voltage deviations, a 39% decrease in frequency deviations, and a 37% improvement in ESS utilization efficiency. The proposed method effectively mitigated voltage spikes that previously rose above 1.04 p.u., successfully limiting peak voltage levels to 1.03 p.u. and lower. Similarly, during peak evening demand conditions, the voltage dips that fell below 0.95 p.u. were stabilized above 0.96 p.u.

However, main limitations are: (1) Insufficient exploration of the complex correlations among diverse loads and between loads and meteorological factors; and (2) Feature information extraction only from the time dimension, neglecting the spatial dimension, resulting in incomplete feature information extraction. This paper proposes a new method for short-term load forecasting, namely the Attention Spatial–temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ATSTGCN) method. Firstly, the Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) method is used to analyze the correlation between diverse loads, meteorological features, and load features, constructing the input data for the graph neural network. Then, synchronous graph convolution is introduced to extract information between features. Next, the spatio-temporal attention mechanism is incorporated into the synchronous graph convolution to capture spatio-temporal features and reduce information loss using a spatio-temporal window. Finally, a short-term load forecasting method based on ATSTGCN for regional integrated energy systems is constructed.

Effective wind speed forecasting is crucial for wind energy production and power grid's stability. To mitigate high-frequency interference in wind speed signals and improve spatiotemporal feature extraction, we propose a novel short-term wind speed prediction model called WST-Informer. Firstly, Wavelet Decomposition (WD) is fused to erase high-frequency noise in monitored signal series. Secondly, Informer encoder is designed to capture long-term temporal dependencies efficiently, and multiple cities' spatio-temporal maps are constructed through designing Residual Graph Convolutional Network (RS-GCN). Moreover, a new Attentional Feature Fusion (AFF) method is designed to fuse temporal and spatial features. Furthermore, the decoder of the Informer predicts outcomes using fused features. Additionally, outliers are more prone to bigger errors and highly curtail in real-world application, a Kernel Mean Squared Error (KMSE) loss function is introduced to further enhance their prediction. With real datasets from weather stations across five Danish cities and seven Dutch cities, extensive experiments were conducted, and the proposed model demonstrates reduced prediction error across multiple forecasting steps in both datasets, resulting in lower prediction errors during sudden wind speed changes, outperforming current state-of-the-art time series forecasting models. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:45","2025-11-26 08:19:28","","","","","176","","Appl.

To foresee congestion scenarios and lay out flexibility-providing distributed energy resources, power flow calculations are generally required. Since power flow calculations are computationally expensive, various neural network architectures have been developed in the literature to infer power flow estimates. In the present paper, we extend the application of a graph neural network (GNN) architecture initially developed for power flow approximation to infer minimum load or generation requirements for congestion mitigation. Evaluating different training procedures and models, we find that a two-step training process using a pre-trained power flow inferring GNN has a head start in training compared to end-to-end training of the GNN. The pre-trained model demonstrates robust generalization capabilities, effectively inferring optimal power values for congestion mitigation across grid topologies outside of the training distribution.

However, the complex interrelationships among multiple loads within the integrated community energy system often hinder the improvement of load forecasting accuracy. To address the issue of high volatility in forecasting caused by the deep coupling of load relationships, a short-term load forecasting method for integrated community energy systems based on Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Neural Network (STGCN) is proposed. Firstly, an integrated energy node clustering method is proposed, considering load fluctuation characteristics to address the error superposition problem caused by an excessive number of load nodes. Similar load nodes are gathered to reduce random errors in cooling and heating loads. Secondly, we design a dynamic adjacency matrix construction method based on load bias correlation to address situations where multiple load correlations influence each other. Bias correlation is utilized for the dynamic update of the matrix, ensuring accurate load correlations. Furthermore, we construct an STGCN-based integrated energy load forecasting model to mitigate short-term load forecasting fluctuations and identify different periodic patterns for distinct loads. The model incorporates multi-scale convolution kernels to capture integrated energy local features, enhancing feature representation and improving load forecasting accuracy. The proposed method is tested and verified using a real integrated community energy system dataset, showing higher prediction accuracy. Specifically, when compared to the current mainstream MTL-LSTM model, the proposed method predicts an 18.1 % increase in the MAPE index. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-17 18:58:45","2025-11-25 14:02:42","","","","","232","","Electr Power Syst Res","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/XSN549C3/Cao et al. - 2024 - A short-term load forecasting method for integrated community energy system based on STGCN.pdf","","#done; Convolutional neural network; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Load forecasting; Convolution; Electric power plant loads; Short term load forecasting; Spatio-temporal graphs; Energy systems; Random errors; Spatio-temporal graph convolutional neural network; Community energy; Correlation network; Integrated community energy system; Load characteristics; STGCN; #forecasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, such standard models consider each time-series individually, neglecting spatial and logical correlations between them. In real-world applications, forecasting models must also balance predictive accuracy with practical constraints such as computational cost, available resources, and deployment feasibility. As a solution, in this paper we propose graph-based extensions of structured state-space models for prediction tasks in renewable energy datasets, represented by solar and wind power plants. In order to explore the effectiveness of state-space mechanisms in this context, we adopt the Spatial-Temporal Graph Mamba model, which demonstrates excellent predictive performance but involves a relatively high computational cost due to its complexity. To address this limitation, we also introduce two lightweight and computationally efficient models, namely miniGConvLSTM and miniGConvGRU, which effectively combine the benefits of state-space modeling with graph-based processing. These models aim at striking a better balance between accuracy and resource efficiency, making them particularly suitable for real-world forecasting scenarios.

Additionally, an embedding project layer is integrated to enhance the graph learning layer. Subsequently, a graph recurrent layer consisting graph convolutional kernel and gated recurrent unit is employed to extract spatial-temporal features from the observations. We evaluate the proposed ASTGRN model using a real-world EV GPS trajectory dataset containing charging information of over 76,000 EVs in Beijing. The experiment results suggest that ASTGRN achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to those advanced spatial-temporal prediction models (e.g., Temporal Graph Convolutional Network and GraphWave Net). The effectiveness of the proposed model in charging demand prediction indicates that the spatial correlation between different charging stations may not be related to geographical distance in the charging demand prediction task, and the use of prior knowledge of geographical location may undermine model performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:45","2025-11-25 16:21:18","","","","","383","","Appl.

Machine learning models, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have emerged as a promising solution, demonstrating superior performance across varying electricity transmission network topologies. Despite the availability of many GNN convolution operators, there is limited research comparing their effectiveness in solving the AC-OPF problem. This paper conducts an empirical evaluation of seven homogeneous GNN convolution operators, spanning a variety of graph data processing techniques. The operators are compared on the basis of losses (mean squared error and constraint violation loss), convergence rate, and computational cost (training time). The findings reveal that GINConv strikes the best balance between losses and computational cost, while the inclusion of edge features in the convolution operation generally improves model convergence behavior. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:46","2025-11-25 14:02:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

Simplified approaches, such as DC power flow, perform well in transmission grids but struggle in distribution grids due to high resistance-to-reactance (R/X) ratios that affect voltage stability and power losses. Recent advances in machine learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer a flexible, topology-aware alternative for power flow solvers, but existing models lack generalizability and fail to incorporate critical topological features. This work presents the first framework for assessing the generalization performance of these graph-based solvers, including a generalization score to evaluate this model robustness. By analyzing graph similarity statistics and their correlation with model performance, we explore the generalization impact of embedding simple graph characteristics into GNN models for distribution grids, and ultimately demonstrate that neighbourhood-aware GNNs produce more generalizable solutions.

To overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes a hybrid approach for enhancing EV charging navigation in SG.

Well-presented topology diagrams provide better situational awareness for the operators, but their efficient generation remains a challenge. Existing approaches struggle to find a balance between visual aesthetics and the generation speed of the diagram. With the rapid changes in power system topology, there is a higher demand for the rendering speed of the graph data. To satisfy both the real-time requirement and the aesthetic quality, this paper proposes an integrated framework for efficiently generating power system topology diagrams. It consists of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model and a graph fine-tuning model. This framework can directly optimize the raw topology diagram while preserving the relative positions of nodes in the initial layout. It achieves a decent trade-off between layout quality and computational expenses, enabling the generation of aesthetically satisfactory diagrams in a short time. Due to the strong generalization ability of GNN, the proposed model can be trained on small system datasets and used for inference on large systems. Case studies verify that the proposed GNN model can optimize the aesthetic metrics of topology diagram layouts within seconds to an average value of 0.55.

This study adopts a risk-informed approach to TEP, formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem that concurrently minimizes systemic risks and expansion costs. Given the intractability of this problem with conventional solvers, we turn to artificial intelligence techniques. In particular, we conceptualize power grids as graphs and introduce a goal-oriented graph generation methodology using deep reinforcement learning. We extend welfare-Q learning, a modified variant of Q-learning tailored to yield high rewards across multiple dimensions, by incorporating geometric deep learning for function approximation. This allows us to account for system security while minimizing grid expansion costs. Notably, system risk is evaluated by incorporating a Graph Neural Network (GNN) cascading failure meta-model into the proposed approach. The TEP method is applied to the IEEE 118-bus system, and the efficacy of this novel technique is compared against the state of the art. We conclude that the deep reinforcement learning method can compete with established methods for multi-objective optimization, identifying expansion strategies that improve system security at reduced costs. Furthermore, we test the robustness of the meta-model against topology changes in the transmission network, demonstrating its applicability to novel grid configurations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:46","2025-11-25 21:48:07","","","","","149","","Eng Appl Artif Intell","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/BX4R9DYI/Varbella et al. - 2025 - Goal-oriented graph generation for transmission expansion planning.pdf","","#done; Power grids; Graph neural networks; Neural-networks; Deep reinforcement learning; Reinforcement learnings; Cascading failures; Graph representation; Graph representation learning; Neural networks; Multi-objectives optimization; Multiobjective optimization; Transmission expansion-planning; Power grid; Goal-oriented; Multi-objective optimization; Oriented graph; Transmission expansion planning; #optimization-control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable performance in abundant natural language processing and computer vision tasks. However, the conventional LLMs fail to learn the complex spatial and temporal correlations of the wind speed data at multiple turbines in a wind farm, which makes wind speed forecasting cannot fully benefit from the significant breakthroughs of LLM. To fill in this gap, we propose a novel spatial–temporal cross-attention LLM framework for wind speed forecasting, namely, spatial–temporal cross-attention LLM (STCA-LLM), composed of alignment phase, and finetuning phase. In detail, our contributions are given as follows. First, the alignment phase aligns the general-purpose LLM with task-specific data, i.e., training the LLM with wind speed data. Second, in the fine-tuning phase, two representation learning modules, i.e., convolution network and graph neural network (GNN) are, respectively used to extract temporal features of intra time series in each turbine, and the correlation of inter time-series at multiple turbines in a wind farm. Moreover, the cross-attention module is innovatively proposed to establish the connections between spatial and temporal embeddings. Then, the spatial–temporal representation modules and the aligned LLM are fine-tuned in two-stage way. Finally, thorough experiments on real wind speed dataset demonstrate that our proposed STCA-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art time series forecasting models, including Transformer-based models, spatial–temporal GNN-based models, and pertained LLM-based models. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:46","2025-11-25 14:02:42","","45411-45422","","21","12","","IEEE Internet Things J.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/DBM2WBS7/Zhou et al. - 2025 - STCA-LLM Spatial-Temporal Cross-Attention Large Language Model for Wind Speed Forecasting.pdf","","#done; Forecasting; Wind turbines; Time series; Wind farm; Wind forecasting; Spatial temporals; Neural networks; Wind power; Electric utilities; Wind speed; Graph attention network; graph attention network (GAT); Wind speed forecasting; Spatio-temporal data; Natural language processing systems; Tuning; wind speed forecasting; Language model; Wind effects; Large language model; Fine tuning; large language model (LLM); Spatial-temporal cross-attention; spatial–temporal cross-attention; Wind speed data; #forecasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This manuscript presents a novel approach to designing a smart-microgrid (SMG) system that uses advanced power compensation methods to enhance power quality in low-inertia systems. The proposed system integrates a combination of crested porcupine optimization (CPO) method with the dual-stream multidependency graph neural network (DMGNN) technique. The adaptive power quality compensator (APQC) used in the proposed system combines shunt and series compensators. Reducing transient voltage fluctuations and stabilizing the dynamic voltage profile are benefits of using a thyristor-controlled series capacitor (TCSC) as the series compensator. A shunt active power filter (SAPF) is used as a shunt compensator to lower voltage and current harmonics and raise the power factor. The DMGNN predicts the best PID controller parameter. Simulation results validate in MATLAB and the efficiency of the proposed technique in achieving superior PQ and operational efficiency compared to existing approaches such as modified water wave optimization (MWWO), multiobjective grey wolf optimizer (MOGWO), and enhanced bald eagle search (EBES) optimization achieving a total harmonic distortion (THD) of 0.1% and an efficiency of 98.7%, highlighting its effectiveness in improving power quality and system performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:46","2025-11-25 21:48:07","","","","","","","Energy Technol.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: John Wiley and Sons Inc","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/4GGQWT99/Ramasamy et al. - 2025 - Advanced Compensation-Based Power Quality Enhancement and Harmonic Mitigation in Smart Microgrids wi.pdf","","#done; Graph neural networks; Power; Renewable energy; Microgrids; Power quality; Adaptive control systems; Quality control; Harmonic analysis; MATLAB; Adaptive power quality compensator; adaptive power quality compensators; Controllers; Electric control equipment; harmonic distortions; Harmonics distortion; PID controllers; power qualities; Power quality compensators; Proportional control systems; Smart Micro Grids; Speed control; Three term control systems; Thyristor controlled series capacitor; thyristor controlled series capacitors; Thyristors; voltage sags; Voltage sags; voltage swells; Voltage swells; Wave filters; #optimization-control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As versatile distributed energy systems, microgrids necessitate adept management and dispatch of various loads - spanning electricity, heat, cooling, and energy storage. Nevertheless, these loads exhibit intricate spatiotemporal correlations and heterogeneities, posing formidable challenges for load forecasting. Current methods predominantly concentrate on time series correlations, neglecting the spatiotemporal data's heterogeneity, thereby inadequately serving practical applications. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces a novel multi-load prediction model for microgrids, rooted in the Spatial-Temporal Synchronous Graph Convolutional Network (STSGCN). This model integrates Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), synergistically capturing both the correlations and heterogeneities within spatiotemporal data. Simulation outcomes underscore the model's effectiveness, with the STSGCN model demonstrating a significant reduction in average absolute error - approximately 13% compared to traditional LSTM, 7% versus GCN, and 5% GCN-LSTM prediction models.

The task becomes even more difficult if measurements devices are placed only at some network nodes. We show that regression graph neural networks we construct, combined with a suitable statistical methodology, can solve this task very well. A chief advance of our methods is that we construct networks that produce localization without having being trained on data that contain fault localization information.

However, the load within the IES exhibits diversified and strongly coupled characteristics, which seriously affects the forecast accuracy. Moreover, only using deep learning forecasting methods cannot analyze the factors that affect the forecast results, which is not conducive to guiding the optimization and scheduling of comprehensive energy systems. Therefore, a multivariate load forecasting model based on knowledge-guided multi-task spatial-temporal synchronous graph convolutional network is proposed. Firstly, the user clusters are classified according to the energy-using characteristics of different buildings. Then, the domain knowledge base is built by combining the dimensionless trends of different groups and expert experience. At the same time, the input features are filtered based on the improved maximum information coefficient method to construct spatial-temporal graph data, forming a more refined and efficient input sample data. Finally, the knowledge-data fusion model for multivariate load forecasting is constructed to predict local fluctuations of the multivariate load series and reconstruct the load ratio.

However, DL-based DSA faces challenges related to model robustness against topology changes and database imbalances. Although an accurate model can be trained for a particular topology, it often does not work for other topologies and requires updating. Also, most existing methods consider a balanced labeled database to train a DL-based model optimally. Meanwhile, as modern power systems become more stable, the number of secure operating conditions is far more than that of insecure ones. This causes the training database to be imbalanced and reduces the model's efficiency. This paper addresses these two challenges with the help of transfer learning (TL) and conditional tabular generative adversarial networks (CTGAN). This paper first generates synthetic data using CTGAN, which helps create a balanced and representative training database to combat the negative effects of an imbalanced database. Then, the power system is zoned, and for each zone, a model based on a graph convolutional network (GCN) is trained with a balanced database to achieve better performance. The GCN-based model improves evaluation accuracy using power system topological information as an adjacency matrix. Since the impact of topology changes on fault behavior is not the same throughout the power system, power system zoning prevents unnecessary updates to some zones. Finally, when the power system topology changes, using maximum mean difference (MMD), the zones that need to be updated are determined, and the transfer approach for these zones is selected. In this paper, for high MMD, the fine-tuning approach of the entire model is employed, and for low MMD, the fine-tuning approach of the last two dense layers is employed. Using two different transfer approaches based on the MMD value reduces model update time and ensures effective performance. The proposed model was implemented on the IEEE 118-bus system and analyzed based on various indicators, and the results show its effectiveness. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:46","2025-11-25 14:02:53","","","","","25","","Result.

The framework integrates temporal attention mechanisms, adversarial scenario synthesis, and graph-based optimization into a unified architecture, effectively overcoming the limitations of conventional methods in managing redundant data and rare yet impactful grid events. The ADS framework comprises three core modules: (1) a temporal attention gate that dynamically prioritizes high-impact time segments, (2) an adversarial scenario sampler that generates synthetic critical load scenarios to enhance robust training, and (3) a dynamic load balancer that optimizes power flow decisions using graph neural networks. Additionally, the framework ensures practical deployability by seamlessly integrating with legacy grid control systems while adhering to strict safety constraints. Extensive experimental validation on real-world smart grid datasets demonstrates significant improvements in computational efficiency and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Despite demand response (DR) incents loads to better complement renewable generations, it can in turn aggravate hindrance of renewable energies' exporting consumption. To solve this issue, spatiotemporal cooperation between DR and TTC must be involved. Further challenge relates to complicated interaction between price-incentive DR and stability constrained TTC. A hybrid learning-aided cooperative dispatch method is thus proposed. Firstly, to mitigate over-conservative power transfer and reduce the high-dimensional dynamic security bounds, a neural network is introduced to fast track dynamic TTC varying with the dispatch model. It is then reformulated as mixed integer linear programming (MILP) and seamlessly integrated into the optimization process along with price-based DRs. At last, to help fast approach optimum of the DR-TTC-cooperative model, a physics-regularized temporal graph convolutional network is utilized to warmly initialize units' on/off status, DRs and energy storages' active states, and auxiliary integer variables introduced from MILP-reformed TTC estimator as well.

MRGNN partitions input sequences into multi-resolution segments to capture both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends while leveraging graph neural networks to model spatial–temporal dependencies.

Accurate EV load forecasting relies on analyzing historical data and properly integrating relevant factors. Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have recently gained attention for time series forecasting. In this context, we propose the Integrated Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (ID-GCN). It comprises of the Features Extraction Unit (FE), the Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks Unit (DGCN), and the Transformer block for the output gate. The FE block processes and depicts the historical energy consumption, while the DGCN, a dynamic application of graph network, uses user transition flow to learn transition distribution and the stations' spatial representation to generate the adjacency matrix. This approach provides thorough spatial analysis and learning of the charging network and node interconnection, leading to accurate forecasts of complex EV charging demands. The ID-GCN model has been proven to outperform traditional and recent spatiotemporal forecasting methods regarding predictive accuracy for short-and long-term forecasts.

This manuscript presents a hybrid technique for congestion management in power systems (CMPS) with significant penetration of RES. The proposed scheme is a joined execution of a Similarity-Navigated Graph Neural Network (SNGNN) and Black-Winged Kite Optimization Algorithm (BKOA), which is commonly named as an SNGNN-BKOA approach. The major goal of the study is to reduce minimum relieving congestion costs and power loss. The load demand is predicted using the SNGNN technique. The BKOA is used to optimize the congestion mitigation cost. The proposed method optimizes ESS charging and discharging to eliminate RES-related uncertainty and relieve congestion. A proposed method is used to address congestion, which is viewed as a non-linear problem. The proposed BKOA-SNGNN approach is implemented in the MATLAB platform and compared their performance with various existing strategies. The existing approaches are Salp Swarm Optimization (SSA) and Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO). The proposed strategy indicates better performance in power system optimization by effectively reducing congestion relief costs and transmission losses. It consistently achieves lower congestion relief costs over time, highlighting its adaptability to varying operational conditions. The method also achieves the lowest system loss of 48.4 MW and the smallest RMSE of 0.164 %, ensuring higher accuracy and reliability. These results underscore its robustness and effectiveness in enhancing overall system performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:46","2025-11-25 21:48:07","","","","","118","","J.

However, photovoltaic power generation is subject to the influence of weather and other factors and has great randomness and unpredictability. Considering that the light intensity that affects photovoltaic power generation has great geographical and spatial similarity, the temporal and spatial similarity characteristics between stations can be used for correlation prediction. In order to fully explore the spatial similarity of photovoltaic system sites, similarity graphs such as geographical distance, altitude, equipment parameters and meteorological conditions between stations are constructed based on the prior knowledge of photovoltaic power generation physics and light intensity location altitude. Furthermore, spatiotemporal joint modeling and cross-graph joint convolution are performed on each similarity graph, and the results of graph convolution are aggregated and superimposed to strengthen the spatiotemporal characteristics and correlation of various influencing factors of photovoltaic power generation. The spatiotemporal joint modeling introduces a contextual gating mechanism and uses the historical data of similar photovoltaic power stations as context information to learn spatiotemporal dependencies. On the public PVOD dataset, the proposed spatiotemporal joint graph convolution prediction model based on multi-parameter similarity is significantly better than prediction models such as LSTM and STCNN. Compared with STCNN, which is also a spatiotemporal graph convolutional network, the prediction error is reduced by 20%. Ablation experiments show that the introduction of spatial correlation of different parameters has a greater impact on the prediction performance, and the model prediction performance improves with the increase of superimposed correlation parameters. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-17 18:58:46","2025-11-25 16:21:18","","81-88","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - IEEE Int.

In real-world scenarios, such as complex electrical power system settings, capturing both correlations is important, as spatio-temporal contains vital geographical information and complex inter-series relationships between features. To address these limitations, we propose AutoGRN for enhancing prediction accuracy and efficiency in multi-source spatio-temporal data fusion, with a focus on complex electrical power system settings. AutoGRN integrates a novel adaptive multi-channel attentive framework with copula-based dependency modeling, combining graph neural diffusion convolution and recurrent optimization. The framework automatically learns spatial features, capturing complex correlations among regions, while a sequence encoder extracts temporal patterns, ensuring the acquisition of time series characteristics such as seasonality and trends. High-dimensional spatio-temporal features are then fused through a specially designed multi-channel recurrent graph neural network, incorporating copula functions to model complex dependencies between variables. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world electricity consumption datasets demonstrate that AutoGRN achieves substantial advantages over state-of-the-art benchmarks in multi-variate prediction tasks, showcasing its potential for applications in various multi-sensor, multi-source fusion scenarios, particularly in complex systems requiring simultaneous analysis of spatial and temporal dynamics with intricate inter-variable dependencies.

However, PV power generation systems are highly influenced by environmental factors, exhibiting strong volatility and randomness, which creates challenges for grid dispatching. Conducting power forecasting for PV stations is thus essential to optimize grid operations. Yet, due to outdated communication systems in existing PV stations, integrated energy system cannot directly access operational data from all PV stations, making power forecasting difficult to implement. This paper proposes a method for predicting regional photovoltaic power generation using limited operational data from a few photovoltaic stations, based on long short-term memory (LSTM) network and graph neural networks (GNN). By deeply exploring the spatiotemporal characteristic relationships between these stations and the overall regional PV power generation, the method achieves data-driven, high-precision, and rapid power forecasting. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:47","2025-11-25 14:02:42","","1133-1136","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Int.

However, existing Directed Greybox Fuzzing (DGF) methods face challenges, such as the need for manual identification of vulnerable code and limitations to specific architectures. This paper proposes a DGF approach, guided by intermediate representation similarity comparison, comprising two main components: objective function localization and directed greybox fuzzing. In the objective function localization phase, support for multiple architectures is achieved by lifting the binary code to LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR). Given that functions may vary in both structure and semantics, we represent functions using both structural and semantic features. We employ word embedding techniques based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and graph neural network models to construct feature vectors. By calculating the feature similarity between each function and known vulnerable functions, we automatically identify highly similar functions as targets. In the directed greybox fuzzing phase, to address issues like high false positive rates and unreachable targets, we designed a target scheduling mechanism. This mechanism permanently blocks targets that have been sufficiently covered and periodically blocks those that have not been covered, thereby further improving the efficiency of fuzzing. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in identifying vulnerabilities in power terminal equipment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:47","2025-11-25 21:48:14","","","","","90","","J.

In addition, the renewable energy system cannot achieve consistent operation because of the uncertainty of renewable energy sources (RES) and their complex spatiotemporal patterns. Climate change and extreme meteorological phenomena also affect the energy system of the island. Therefore, it is essential to maximize RES exploitation to accomplish carbon-free energy production. This study developed a rolling horizon optimization–based flexible renewable energy distribution planning (FxRE-Plan) based on an artificial intelligence-driven spatiotemporal RES prediction model. An adaptive graph convolutional recurrent network (AGCRN) was used to develop a spatiotemporal prediction model. Then, FxRE-Plan was determined using a multiobjective genetic algorithm to maximize the RES potential under climate change scenarios. The FxRE-Plan was evaluated and compared with the current operation of the electric grid in Jeju Island through economic, environmental cost, and climate change vulnerability assessment index. The results of this research show that the AGCRN–based spatiotemporal prediction model exhibited superior prediction performance, achieving a 95% R2. In addition, the FxRE-Plan reduced greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 11.5% at maximum and climate change vulnerability. Hence, the proposed FxRE-Plan can be used to solve curtailments in real electric grids by pursuing carbon-free islands. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2023","2025-11-17 18:58:47","2025-11-25 14:02:42","","","","","282","","Energy","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/43TKGVRI/Kim et al. - 2023 - Flexible renewable energy planning based on multi-step forecasting of interregional electricity supp.pdf","","#done; Forecasting; Renewable energies; Renewable energy resources; Renewable energy sources; alternative energy; Renewable energy source; Economics; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Genetic algorithms; Carbon; Climate change; Natural resources; Spatio-temporal prediction; Carbon-free; climate change; Climate change vulnerability assessment; Distribution planning; electricity; electricity supply; Energy distributions; energy planning; Energy planning; Flexible energy planning; genetic algorithm; greenhouse gas; Spatiotemporal prediction; vulnerability; Vulnerability assessments; #forecasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address these challenges, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model is proposed to solve the OPF while ensuring constraints are satisfied rapidly. A heterogeneous multi-agent proximal policy optimization (H-MAPPO) DRL algorithm is introduced for multi-area power systems. Each agent is responsible for regulating the output of generation units in a specific area, and together, the agents work to achieve the global OPF objective, which reduces the complexity of the DRL model’s training process. Additionally, a graph neural network (GNN) is integrated into the DRL framework to capture spatiotemporal features such as RES fluctuations and power grid topological structures, enhancing input representation and improving the learning efficiency of the DRL model. The proposed DRL model is validated using the RTS-GMLC test system, and its performance is compared to MATPOWER with the interior-point iterative solver. The RTS-GMLC test system is a power system with high spatial–temporal resolution and near-real load profiles and generation curves. Test results demonstrate that the proposed DRL model achieves a 100% convergence and feasibility rate, with an optimal generation cost similar to that provided by MATPOWER. Furthermore, the proposed DRL model significantly accelerates computation, achieving up to 85 times faster processing than MATPOWER. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:47","2025-11-25 14:02:49","","","","7","18","","Energies","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/L8JBEKZR/Zhou et al. - 2025 - Optimal Power Flow for High Spatial and Temporal Resolution Power Systems with High Renewable Energy.pdf","","#done; Graph neural networks; optimal power flow; graph neural network; Load flow optimization; Deep reinforcement learning; Reinforcement learnings; Reinforcement learning; Optimal power flows; Multi agent; Renewable energy source; multi-agent reinforcement learning; Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Reinforcement learning models; High spatial resolution; High temporal resolution; renewable energy source; Test systems; #optimization-control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address this issue, a two-stage graph spatiotemporal attention network (Ts-GSAN) fault location method is proposed for distributed energy systems. First, a low-observable node selection mechanism is proposed to realize global awareness of the system based on the least amount of data, which accounts the propagation mechanism of fault unbalanced current. Second, a graph spatiotemporal attention mechanism is proposed to solve the problem of feature propagation path change due to topology reconfiguration, which captures the feature attenuation during fault propagation. Furthermore, a two-stage graph neural network method is proposed for fault localization, which solves the problem of interference between various fault types through a localization-correction mechanism. Ts-GSAN realizes the global fault awareness of the system based on a small number of devices, which can ensure the generalizability to different topologies and the localization accuracy. Finally, experimental validation is carried out through IEEE 123 node distributed energy systems.

However, model-free DRL-based VVC approaches usually cannot capture the important topological feature of the power system since they use a fully-connected network (FCN) to deliver the action. Therefore, this paper proposes a graph convolutional network (GCN)-based DRL approach that can employ the topological information of the network to take better control action for regulating the voltage. Our implementation allows for both centralized and decentralized configurations, utilizing a single agent and multiple agents respectively. Although the centralized GCN-based DRL approach has its advantages of minimizing voltage fluctuation and power loss, it is not suitable for large scale power systems due to its challenges in terms of scalability, computation speed and potential single points of failure. Therefore, these problems can be resolved using the decentralized GCN-based DRL approach. Moreover, to ensure the safe operation of the model, our proposed approach incorporates an exponential barrier function while formulating the reward function for each agent. To validate performance of the proposed approaches, the proposed model is tested on modified IEEE test systems and the performances are measured in terms on voltage fluctuation reduction, minimization of power loss and computational speed. The results show that the proposed topology-aware approach outperforms the FCN-based DRL approach in terms of reducing voltage fluctuation and minimizing power loss of the network. Moreover, it is shown that the decentralized GCN-based DRL has faster computational speed than other approaches. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:47","2025-11-25 14:02:49","","5394-5405","","4","61","","IEEE Trans Ind Appl","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/39GMGW8R/Hossain et al. - 2025 - Topology-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Voltage Control Centralized and Decentralized Strategies.pdf","","#done; Convolutional networks; Network topology; Deep reinforcement learning; Distribution grid; Graph theory; Multi agent; Inverters; Decentralised; Inverter; Centralised; distribution grids; Actor critic; graphical convolutional network; Graphical convolutional network; soft actor-critic; Soft actor-critic; VAR control; Volt-VAR control; Centralized and decentralized regulation; centralized and decentralized regulations; Decentralized control; Decentralized systems; multi-agent-soft actor-critic; Multi-agent-soft actor-critic; #optimization-control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Community structure, as an important topological characteristic of complex networks, plays a prominent role in power grid research and application. The current methods for community division of power networks are mainly based on the topological characteristics of the network, with less consideration of the power balance of the subnetwork, which requires larger-scale machine-cutting or load-cutting operations when the subnetwork operates independently after the grid is unbundled. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a community segmentation method for power networks based on graph neural networks that integrally considers the topology of the network and the power balance of the network. Node attributes such as node degree, betweenness, and power value are selected as node features to help the model capture more correlations between nodes. The traditional K-means algorithm is also optimized and improved, and the method of selecting generator nodes as the clustering centers is proposed to ensure that there are generator nodes supplying energy in each community.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid deep learning model based on spatiotemporal graph contrastive learning to address the above issues. Specifically, the model's encoder combines an adaptive graph convolutional network with LSTM to capture fine-grained spatiotemporal dependencies. To enhance the robustness of the encoder against data noise, we apply feature-level and topology-level data augmentation techniques to the model's input and design two contrastive learning auxiliary tasks from the temporal and spatial dimensions, respectively. Furthermore, to capture more comprehensive spatial correlations, we construct an adaptive graph by fusing the static graph with a learnable parameter matrix.

Firstly, we use the Pearson correlation coefficient to analyze the correlation between the bus load and meteorological features and the correlation among loads on buses within the same supply area. Then, the fully connected spatial-temporal graph, according to the supply area's single line diagram, is constructed, including the spatial correlations between buses within the same supply area and the temporal correlations within the bus load series.

To address these issues, a Meta-learning enhanced physics-informed graph attention convolutional network (Meta-PIGACN) model is proposed to handle topological variability in distribution system state estimation (DSSE). Specifically, physics information is integrated into the graph convolutional network, enabling a physics-informed edge-weighting process that incorporates physical information to control the aggregation of neighboring nodes. Besides, the graph attention mechanism automatically adjusts the importance of different neighboring nodes, allowing the capture and preservation of inherent system features across varying topologies, thereby improving state estimation accuracy. Furthermore, meta-learning is proposed to acquire empirical knowledge across multiple topologies so that the model can rapidly adapt to new configurations through iterative gradient descent updates even in large-scale systems.

Traditional fault identification and power outage prediction methods face problems of insufficient accuracy and weak generalization ability due to the difficulty in handling the spatiotemporal coupling of meteorological power grid data and small sample extreme scenarios. Therefore, this study proposes a deep learning based DL-RAEWM model and constructs an end-to-end intelligent monitoring framework of 'data augmentation spatiotemporal feature fusion hierarchical prediction'. The model enhances extreme scenario samples by generating adversarial networks, and utilizes graph convolutional neural networks and Transformers to fuse power grid topology spatial correlations and meteorological temporal dynamic features, achieving collaborative modeling of fault type recognition and power outage duration prediction. The experimental results show that in extreme weather scenarios with a scale of 100 power grids, the model has a power outage detection rate of 98%, a fault prediction rate of 85%, and an accuracy rate of 95%, which significantly improves the performance compared to traditional methods. The model inference delay is controlled within 12.3 ms to meet the real-time warning requirements of the power grid. The research results provide high-precision data support for emergency response of the power grid under extreme weather conditions, and its spatiotemporal fusion modeling and data augmentation technology effectively solve the problem of coupling modeling of multi-source heterogeneous data.

The GNNs are trained using supervised learning to predict the power grid's aggregated bus-level (either zonal or system-level) or individual branch-level state under different power supply and demand conditions. The variability of the stochastic grid variables (wind/solar generation and load demand), and their statistical correlations, are considered while generating the inputs for the training data. The outputs in the training data include system-level, zonal and transmission line-level quantities of interest (QoIs). The ground truth of QoIs are obtained by numerically solving deterministic optimization problems (e.g., security-constrained unit commitment) with the same inputs. The GNN predictions are used to conduct hours-ahead, sampling-based reliability and risk assessment w.r.t. zonal and system-level (load shedding) as well as branch-level (overloading) failure events. The proposed methodology is demonstrated for three synthetic grids with sizes ranging from 118 to 2848 buses. Our results demonstrate that GNNs are capable of providing fast and accurate prediction of QoIs and can be good proxies for computationally expensive optimization algorithms. The excellent accuracy of GNN-based reliability and risk assessment suggests that GNN models can substantially improve situational awareness by enabling quick, high-resolution reliability and risk estimation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:47","2025-11-25 16:21:34","","","","","380","","Appl.

This manuscript proposes a hybrid method for optimizing day-ahead Microgrid (MG) scheduling, incorporating EV and energy sources. The proposed hybrid method is the joint execution of the Sunflower optimization algorithm (SFO) and Contrastive Self-Supervised Graph Neural Network (CSGNN). Hence, it is named as SFO-CSGNN method. The principal aim of the proposed technique is to enhance MG reliability, reduce environmental impact, and improve flexibility, thereby contributing to a smart energy system. The proposed energy system integrates EVs with renewable sources including photovoltaic (PV), wind turbines (WT), and geothermal units (GU). The SFO algorithm optimizes EV charging and discharging schedules, while the CSGNN algorithm predicts the performance under high EV penetration levels. On the MATLAB platform, the proposed strategy is evaluated and contrasted with other existing techniques. The proposed s strategy displays superior outcomes in all existing like the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Sandpiper Optimization Algorithm (SOA).

Seasonal-trend decomposition based on LOESS (STL) is an efficient method for handling the intricacy and fluctuation of load data. However, different types of components reflect different levels of information and have different importance in terms of capturing temporal features. Moreover, graph convolutional network (GCN) is often utilized to capture the non-Euclidean spatial features in load data. However, as the number of network nodes increases, the generalization capacity of the GCN decreases. Therefore, a novel spatiotemporal model, namely, multitask GCN with attention-based STL (MG-ASTL), is proposed for accurate short-term load forecasting. First, a new attention-based STL method is proposed, which utilizes attention mechanism to weight different components, thus making the proposed model to focus on more important components for more effective temporal feature extraction. Second, a new multitask GCN method is proposed, which utilizes density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) to divide load data into different groups for multitask learning, so that the simple spatial patterns with fewer nodes can be learned to increase the generalization capacity.

In the day-ahead optimization stage, to improve the level of renewable energy consumption, the ladder-type regulation performance of thermal power units involved in deep peak load with frequency regulation capacity is derived and established.

Spatiotemporal modeling is about modeling those patterns for forecasting future trends and carrying out critical decision-making by leveraging machine learning/deep learning. Once trained offline, field deployment of trained models for near real-time inference could be challenging because performance can vary significantly depending on the environment, available compute resources and tolerance to ambiguity in results. Users deploying spatiotemporal models for solving complex problems can benefit from analytical studies considering a plethora of system adaptations to understand the associated performance-quality trade-offs. To facilitate the co-design of next-generation hardware architectures for field deployment of trained models, it is critical to characterize the workloads of these deep learning (DL) applications during inference and assess their computational patterns at different levels of the execution stack. In this paper, we develop several variants of deep learning applications that use spatiotemporal data from dynamical systems. We study the associated computational patterns for inference workloads at different levels, considering relevant models (Long short-term Memory, Convolutional Neural Network and Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Network), DL frameworks (Tensorflow and PyTorch), precision (FP16, FP32, AMP, INT16 and INT8), inference runtime (ONNX and AI Template), post-training quantization (TensorRT) and platforms (Nvidia DGX A100 and Sambanova SN10 RDU). Overall, our findings indicate that although there is potential in mixed-precision models and post-training quantization for spatiotemporal modeling, extracting efficiency from contemporary GPU systems might be challenging. Instead, co-designing custom accelerators by leveraging optimized High Level Synthesis frameworks (such as SODA High-Level Synthesizer for customized FPGA/ASIC targets) can make workload-specific adjustments to enhance the efficiency. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:48","2025-11-25 17:12:14","","","","","163","","Future Gener Comput Syst","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/29HN9QIW/Jain et al. - 2025 - Analyzing inference workloads for spatiotemporal modeling.pdf","","#done; Convolutional neural networks; Power grids; Graph neural networks; Long short-term memory; Digital storage; Spatio-temporal models; Inference; Graphics processing unit; Computer graphics equipment; Spatiotemporal modeling; Quantisation; Climate condition; Computational patterns; Field deployment; GPU; High level synthesis; High-level synthesis; Performance analysis and profiling; Performance analyze and profiling; Performances analysis; #methodology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One such approach involves placing transformer neutral blocking devices, which interrupt the path of geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) to limit their impact. The high cost of these devices and the sparsity of transformers that experience high GICs during GMD events, however, calls for a sparse placement strategy that involves high computational cost. To address this challenge, we developed a physics-informed heterogeneous graph neural network (PIHGNN) for solving the graph-based dc-blocker placement problem. Our approach combines a heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) with a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to capture the diverse types of nodes and edges in ac/dc networks and incorporates the physical laws of the power grid. We train the PIHGNN model using a surrogate power flow model and validate it using case studies. Results demonstrate that PIHGNN can effectively and efficiently support the deployment of GIC dc-current blockers, ensuring the continued supply of electricity to meet societal demands.

However, most existing methods focus on predicting either transient or voltage stability independently. In real-world scenarios, these two types of instability often co-occur, necessitating distinct and coordinated control strategies. This paper presents a novel concurrent prediction framework for transient and voltage stability using a spatio-temporal embedding graph neural network (STEGNN). The proposed framework utilizes a graph neural network to extract topological features of the power system from adjacency matrices and temporal data graphs. In contrast, a temporal convolutional network captures the system’s dynamic behavior over time. A weighted loss function is introduced during training to enhance the model’s ability to handle instability cases. Experimental validation on the IEEE 118-bus system demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method compared to single stability prediction approaches. The STEGNN model is further evaluated for its prediction efficiency and robustness to measurement noise.

However, existing forecasting method generally focus on mining the temporal characteristic of PV power time series, without considering the interactions between multiple PV sites. Graph neural network has shown excellent performance in modeling spatial correlation of non-Euclidean structured data, but still has some drawbacks. Specifically, it predefines graph structures based on prior information, which all are static. While the spatial dependence between PV sites changes over time due to uncontrollable meteorological factors. To address this problem, this paper designs a dynamic spatial-temporal graph neural network (DSTGNN) for ultra short-term PV power generation forecasting. it consists of a dynamic graph learning module, a stacked spatial-temporal convolution module and an output module. The stacked spatial-temporal convolution module uses temporal convolution module to model temporal dependence, while utilizing graph convolution module over a dynamic graph to model dynamic spatial dependence. The dynamic graph is constructed based on attention mechanism and real-time input. Experiment results validate that the proposed method achieves better prediction performance than existing methods. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:49","2025-11-25 14:02:42","","43-51","","","1317 LNEE","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

Detecting and recovering from FDIAs is thus critical for maintaining power system integrity. The increasing integration of renewable energy sources and the extensive use of power electronic devices introduce significant randomness in both power generation and loads, leading to significant power fluctuations and dynamic changes in power flows. These variations challenge the accuracy of existing FDIA detection and recovery methods. To address these challenges, an innovative data recovery framework is proposed, comprising two key stages: the FDIA localization stage and the FDIA data recovery stage. In the first stage, a Line Message Passing Neural Network (LMPNN) based FDIA localization model is employed to precisely identify the attacked data and generate a mask input for the recovery stage. In the data recovery stage, an FDIA data recovery model, named Denoising Diffusion Graph Models (DDGM), is designed to recover data with minimal error while conforming to the physical laws of the grid. Both models utilize node graph and line graph representations to depict measurements on buses and branches. By leveraging an optimized graph neural network, and inviting a loop-structured framework that combines a denoising diffusion model with a graph neural network these models effectively extract data features and inherent dynamic properties, enabling superior localization of FDIAs both in node and edge spaces and ensuring accurate recovery of compromised data even in the presence of high uncertainty and significant power fluctuations. By incorporating physical laws through a customized loss function embedding Kirchhoff's circuit laws into the training process of DDGM, the model ensures the recovered data to be physically consistent with power system dynamics. Experimental validations on IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus test systems, under conditions of high fluctuations in generation and loads, demonstrate that the proposed models outperform existing methods, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and robustness. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:49","2025-11-25 21:13:26","","","","","239","","Electr Power Syst Res","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/Y6NS9Z48/He et al. - 2025 - A graph and diffusion theory-based approach for localization and recovery of false data injection at.pdf","","#done; Data recovery; Denoising diffusion graph models; Denoising diffusion implicit models; FDIA localization; Line graph; Line message passing neural network; Neural-networks; Network security; False data injection attacks; Attack localization; Message-passing; Graph model; Linegraph; De-noising; Denoising diffusion graph model; Denoising diffusion implicit model; False data injection attack localization; Implicit modeling; #cybersecurity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Firstly, VAE is applied to study the potential features of power grid load data, which can effectively capture non-linear patterns in data. Secondly, GCN is used to model power network topology, and the spatial dependence of power network nodes in different areas is studied. Through the combination of VAE and GCN, the model is able to study the internal patterns of time series data and the interaction among them. To improve the training stability, a modified KL divergence loss function is proposed to solve the problem of unstable VAE in training. Then, the real load data of an intelligent grid is verified and compared with the conventional ARIMA, SVR and LSTM. The experiment results show that the VAE-GCN hybrid model is better than the traditional methods in MAE, RMSE, and MAPE, especially in long term load forecasting. At last, the paper designs an optimal scheduling strategy for grid load, which is based on deep reinforcement learning, which can efficiently allocate and adjust grid resources dynamically.

Both traditional and renewable power generation systems can be negatively impacted, leading to widespread power outages that compromise public safety. In response, we introduce a novel spatial-topological multi-agent reinforcement learning (ST-MARL) method to optimize post-typhoon power system recovery by leveraging mobile energy resources (MERs). Compared to existing MARL methods, the proposed ST-MARL method utilizes convolutional neural network (CNN) and graph convolutional network (GCN) models to extract spatial-topological information from environmental data like typhoon meteorological conditions and power system states, which facilitates real-time decision-making for the routing and scheduling of MERs. Furthermore, this ST-MARL method achieves a two-stage decision-making process by allocating MERs' rewards with an Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow(AC-OPF) model. This ensures safety and feasibility of the decisions. Additionally, we employ the centralized training and distributed execution (CTDE) paradigm to address coordination challenges among MERs. These approaches collectively aim to enhance coordination among MERs, improve economic efficiency, and ensure the power supply of critical loads during post-typhoon power system recovery. Finally, in our case study of the Hong Kong power network, the results indicate that our ST-MARL method outperforms two main existing MARL methods, achieving an improvement of 5.13% and 6.77% on the reward, respectively. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:49","2025-11-25 14:02:49","","1683-1694","","1","61","","IEEE Trans Ind Appl","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/9MSQAHVF/Zou et al. - 2025 - Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Mobile Energy Resources Scheduling Amidst Typhoons.pdf","","#done; Convolutional neural networks; Power; Reinforcement learning; Electric load flow; Energy; Reinforcement learning method; Multi-agent reinforcement learning; System resiliences; typhoon; Power system resilience; multi-agent reinfor- cement learning; power system recovery; Power system recovery; Resource-scheduling; System recovery; #optimization-control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Concurrently, these technologies expose power systems to cyberattacks, which could lead to voltage instability and significant damage. Traditional false data injection attacks (FDIAs) detectors are inadequate in addressing cyberattacks on voltage regulation since a) they overlook such attacks within power grids and b) primarily rely on static thresholds and simple anomaly detection techniques, which cannot capture the complex interplay between voltage stability, cyberattacks, and defensive actions. To address the aforementioned challenges, this paper develops an FDIA detection approach that considers data falsification attacks on voltage regulation and enhances the voltage stability index. A graph autoencoder-based detector that is able to identify cyberattacks targeting voltage regulation is proposed. A bi-level optimization approach is put forward to concurrently optimize the objectives of both attackers and defenders in the context of voltage regulation. The proposed detector underwent rigorous training and testing across different kinds of attacks, demonstrating enhanced generalization performance in all situations. Simulations were performed on the Iberian power system topology, featuring 486 buses. The proposed model achieves 98.11% average detection rate, which represents a significant enhancement of 10-25% compared to the cutting-edge detectors. This provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of proposed strategy in tackling cyberattacks on voltage regulation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:49","2025-11-25 16:21:59","","12-23","","","12","","IEEE Open Access J.

While traditional VPP models focus on static optimization and energy management, they fall short in capturing the dynamic responses required for transient stability analysis, especially in systems incorporating both grid-following (GFL) and grid-forming (GFM) inverters. The coexistence of GFM and GFL resources introduces complex, nonlinear interactions, which become even more challenging under topological reconfigurations or structural changes in the power systems. This paper proposes a neural network-based spatiotemporal model for dynamic VPP representation using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The GCN captures both the static and dynamic structural topology of an 8-bus VPP system, while the LSTM models temporal behavior. The combined architecture effectively learns the interactions among inverter-based resources under various transient and reconfigured scenarios. High-fidelity Electro-Magnetic Transient (EMT) simulations validate the proposed method, demonstrating superior accuracy and better representation of dynamic behavior compared to conventional benchmark approaches.

Some of them may violate grid constraints and thus, have to be a subject of control. Considering the inherently low level of observability in distribution systems, estimation and assessment of their state becomes a significant challenge, that must be tackled before developing a control strategy. Moreover, the real time state estimation in partially-observable DS can be undetermined or timely infeasible in case of when the small time steps needed. In this paper we propose to use the graph neural network - based state classification, which identifies the possible grid limits violations in the distribution grid. The use of neural network in this case is in line with their main advantages over physical models - they are fast and adaptive. We benchmark several graph neural network approaches, that are based on the topology of the grid, which allows to derive information about unlabeled nodes and increase interpretability - one of the main obstacles on the way to wide neural network utilization in power systems. We set the problem in a semi-supervised manner, which allows us to use less labeled, metered data, as the large parts of modern distribution systems remain not measured. We show that graph neural networks are more precise and explainable in this task compared to the regular ones. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:49","2025-11-25 21:48:02","","266-276","","","15272 LNCS","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

In this paper, a charging station load uncertainty prediction method based on multi-dimensional quantile spatial-temporal traffic flow forecast is proposed. First, considering the complex spatial-temporal correlation characteristics of traffic flow, a traffic flow forecast model based on multi-dimensional spatial-temporal graph convolutional network is designed. The model can deeply explore spatial-temporal correlation characteristics and effectively capture both the static spatial correlations with fixed topological structures and the dynamic spatial correlations of real-time traffic flow. Second, taking into account the importance of prediction results under different confidence levels, this paper combines the forecast model with a weighted quantile regression model and introduces a novel weighted loss function, which can achieve traffic flow uncertainty prediction without the need to predefine the uncertainty probability density distribution and meet the differentiated requirements for uncertainty prediction in grid operation and business decision-making. Furthermore, considering the influence of factors such as road congestion and electricity prices on charging load, a charging station load uncertainty prediction model based on an enhanced queuing model is proposed, which can more accurately convert traffic flow uncertainty into load uncertainty, and thus more accurately simulate the charging station loads.

The proposed framework is successfully tested on various nonisolated (buck, boost) and isolated (flyback, full-bridge) converters under both continuous conduction mode (CCM) and discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) operations. In the comprehensive assessment of the entire framework, its efficacy is tested on 140 newly drawn circuit diagrams. The overall accuracy in the generation of netlists reaches a high value of 95.71%, utilizing the robust component detection capabilities of YOLOv8. Moreover, the framework enables the generation of both graphical representations and adjacency matrices for circuit diagrams. This output serves as a valuable dataset generator, contributing to the rapidly advancing domains of machine learning, including graph neural networks and geometric learning, particularly in the application space of power and energy systems. This framework can be further employed as an educational tool, and the ideas introduced can be developed to generate fully automated and efficient power converter designs for real-world applications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-17 18:58:50","2025-11-25 21:48:02","","115356-115369","","","12","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/NUYSQ7UJ/Bohara and Sarma Krishnamoorthy - 2024 - Deep Learning-Based Framework for Power Converter Circuit Identification and Analysis.pdf","","#done; Accuracy; Graph neural networks; Features extraction; Power; Deep learning; deep learning; Computational modelling; Integrated circuit modeling; Digital elevation model; Photomapping; 'spice'; Automated circuit simulation; Automated graph; automated graph generation; Circuit diagrams; computer vision; Hand-drawn; hand-drawn circuit diagram; Hand-drawn circuit diagram; Netlist; NetList; Optical character recognition; Optical-; power converter; spice; SPICE; #grid-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Operators must design a safe and stable operation mode by considering factors such as load levels, maintenance schedules, and equipment contingencies. However, with the increasing scale of power grids and the growing number of control elements, the traditional manual arrangement method based on experience struggles to efficiently establish a safe and stable operation mode. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an intelligent power system operation mode adjustment method. By training a physicsinformed Graph Neural Network (GNN), a numerical mapping from system states to power flow results is constructed. The proposed method leverages this mapping to adjust system states via gradient descent, thereby alleviating overloaded branches. Additionally, it integrates the N-1 criteria, which induce topology changes, into the adjustment process through the GNN broadcasting mechanism. The newly generated operation mode inherently satisfies the N-1 security verification. Simulations conducted on the IEEE 30-bus system demonstrate that the proposed method can rapidly generate an operation mode satisfying the N-1 verification without requiring extensive memory resources. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:50","2025-11-25 21:48:07","","257-261","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Int.

This paper introduces a novel approach that addresses this issue by adopting graph neural networks (GNN) into the Branch and Bound (B&B), integrating the characteristics of variable selection (VS) within UC problems. Our method focuses on efficiently obtaining optimal solutions using the GNN-guided VS approach. Specifically, we investigate the characteristics of the high-quality but time-consuming VS heuristic when solving UC problems. Then, the GNN incorporates these characteristics to make high-quality VS decisions accurately and quickly. In the implementation, the UC model is solved using a high-quality but time-consuming VS heuristic to collect training data. These data are employed to train the GNN model with designed label-smooth and depth-adaptive mechanisms, which exploit these characteristics in UC problems for acceleration. To evaluate the effectiveness, we conduct various experiments on the IEEE118, RTS-GMLC, and a real-world provincial system in China. The overall performance demonstrates significant improvements (4.6x, 1.5x, and 1.8x, respectively) in computational efficiency. The comparison experiments show that the proposed mechanisms contribute to enhanced learning performance and, thus, further UC acceleration.

The high penetration of renewables leads to a reduction in system inertia, causing increased rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) and frequency deviations, which can threaten grid stability. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel measurement-based hybrid Multi-Head Graph Attention Network and Long Short-Term Memory (GATLSTM) framework for estimating the total inertia constant. Our approach uniquely integrates the spatial awareness of graph attention networks (GATs) to capture the topological dependencies of the power network with the temporal modeling capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to learn from sequential phasor measurement unit (PMU) data. By leveraging PMU measurements of frequency deviation and ROCOF from a dataset based on the IEEE 24-bus system, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GATLSTM model significantly outperforms conventional deep learning models such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) particularly under realistic noise conditions. Extensive experiments, sensitivity analysis, and an ambiguity-set evaluation demonstrate the GAT-LSTM's robustness, superior accuracy, and ability to resolve overlapping-signal cases while providing well-calibrated prediction intervals.

Therefore, a state monitoring model for power distribution network systems is proposed in this study. This study first combined ZigBee technology and multi-core graph attention network to construct the state location transfer network of the power distribution network system, and on this basis, applied the Internet of Things and recurrent neural network to achieve real-time data collection and processing. Subsequently, the collected data are input into the graph neural network and the temporal convolutional network. Through feature extraction and pattern recognition, anomaly location and classification diagnosis are achieved. Experimental results show that when the number of nodes reaches 90, the end-to-end delay of the model is 0.91ms, the routing deployment cost is 1700 USD, the packet delivery rate remains above 91.2%, the accuracy of anomaly localization exceeds 94.8%, and the response time does not exceed 5.1ms. All these results outperform the compared networks. In comprehensive performance verification experiments, the model achieves an average diagnosis accuracy of 97.8% for five types of anomalies. The errors in localization accuracy and classification accuracy are 0.031 and 0.017, respectively, both significantly better than those of the compared models. The proposed state monitoring method for distribution network systems in this study enhances the real-time performance of data transmission and enables precise positioning of abnormal node states, providing a strong guarantee for the stable operation of the power distribution network system.

They have the potential to disrupt the system's stability like frequency stability, thereby leading to catastrophic failures. Therefore, an FDIA detection method would be valuable to protect power systems. FDIAs typically induce a discrepancy between the desired and the effective behavior of the power system dynamics. A suitable detection method can leverage power dynamics predictions to identify whether such a discrepancy was induced by an FDIA. This work investigates the efficacy of temporal and spatio-temporal state prediction models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and a combination of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) with LSTM, for predicting frequency dynamics in the absence of an FDIA but with noisy measurements, and thereby identify FDIA events. For demonstration purposes, the IEEE 39 New England Kron-reduced model simulated with a swing equation is considered. It is shown that the proposed state prediction models can be used as a building block for developing an effective FDIA detection method that can maintain high detection accuracy across various attack and deployment settings. It also shows how the FDIA detection should be deployed to limit its exposure to detection inaccuracies and mitigate its computational burden. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:50","2025-11-26 09:22:47","","12411-12426","","","13","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","15 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-11-26] Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/ZDUVGXWW/Sahu et al. - 2025 - Detection of False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA) on Power Dynamical Systems with a State Prediction.pdf","","#done; graph neural networks; Graph neural networks; Power; Prediction models; False data injection attacks; Attack detection; Detection methods; False data injection; Prediction modelling; Short term memory; Frequency stability; State prediction; dynamic state prediction; long short term memory; Dynamic state predictions; #cybersecurity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Conventional diagnostics, which rely on single signal or quasi-periodic load models, cannot capture high-frequency torque reversals or nonlinear coupling among electrical, mechanical, and oil temperature signals under strong noise. To overcome these limitations, this article proposes a dual-pronged framework for wind turbine gearbox situational awareness in generation–grid–load–storage coordinated operation. First, a multiparameter dynamic model that quantifies interactions among grid dispatch commands, load fluctuations, energy storage dynamics, mechanical stresses, and environmental factors is developed to provide a robust theoretical basis for fault evolution analysis. Second, an improved spatiotemporal difference graph convolutional network (STDGCN) with embedded physical constraints is introduced to fuse heterogeneous signals and derive a multidomain health indicator (HI). Finally, a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) enhanced with an attention mechanism employs HI to deliver situational awareness and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation.

Analyze the correlation degree of each dimension data in the service area, and form the feature vector of the node with the data with large correlation degree. A single-step prediction model of charging load based on graph neural network is established. The graph neural network is used to capture the spatial topological relationships between service areas, while the gated recurrent unit tracks the variations in charging load over time.

GFDF employs GNNs on graphical representation of MGs, augmented with a multi-head attention mechanism, to accurately assimilate dynamics associated with fault events by learning node embeddings. This approach effectively assigns weights to the neighboring nodes based on their contributions, ensuring resilience to abnormal data and adaptability to changing operating conditions. GFDF uses current measurement of single end of each line and line parameters as graph node and link attributes, respectively. Additionally, this paper proposes a robust intelligence-based centralized protection scheme (ICPS), intended to address the failure of legacy protection infrastructure in MGs caused by various logical and physical reasons. It utilizes decisions made by GFDF with accelerated computation throughput using dedicated hardware (GPU-NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650) to meet stringent protection time requirements. A comparative assessment of GFDF with the existing techniques, and the implementation of ICPS on medium voltage CIGRE MGs through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experimentation, leveraging real-time digital simulator (RTDS) setup, and commercial SEL relays to emulate realistic operational environments, validates the practicality of the work. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:50","2025-11-25 14:02:53","","1975-1992","","2","16","","IEEE Trans.

AGRAAN simplifies and accelerates the development of neural networks by automatically identifying optimal architectures through Neural Architecture Search (NAS), enabling efficient learning from limited data using Few-Shot Learning, and enhancing performance through attention mechanisms for time-series forecasting. This integrated approach reduces manual tuning and adapts effectively to various tasks. High levels of solar PV integration in power grids introduce variability due to weather conditions and limited forecasting, often resulting in high operational costs. To address this, the AGRAAN model enhances real-time solar variability prediction, improving adaptability, cost-efficiency, and grid stability. NAS supports architectural optimization, Few-Shot Learning improves adaptability with minimal data, and attention mechanisms enhance forecasting accuracy. Additionally, high PV penetration causes voltage fluctuations and harmonic distortions in diverse grid environments. To mitigate these effects, a complementary system named Graph-Aware Reinforced Autoencoder Control System (GRAACS) is proposed. GRAACS detects and manages power quality issues using Autoencoders for anomaly detection, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for spatial prediction, and Reinforcement Learning for adaptive real-time control. The combined AGRAAN and GRAACS models significantly enhance performance, achieving a high efficiency score of 0.98, an F1-Score of 0.97, and a low Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.11.

Traditional deterministic methods fail to capture the inherent uncertainties associated with intermittent renewable sources and fluctuating demand patterns. This paper proposes a novel denoising diffusion method for multivariate time series probabilistic forecasting that explicitly models the interdependencies between variables through graph modeling. Our framework employs a parallel feature extraction module that simultaneously captures temporal dynamics and spatial correlations, enabling improved forecasting accuracy. Through extensive evaluation on two real-world datasets focused on renewable energy and electricity demand, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in probabilistic energy time series forecasting tasks. By explicitly modeling variable interdependencies and incorporating temporal information, our method provides reliable probabilistic forecasts, crucial for effective decision-making and resource allocation in the energy sector. Extensive experiments validate that our proposed method reduces the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) by 2.1%–70.9%, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 4.4%–52.2%, and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) by 7.9%–53.4% over existing methods on two real-world datasets. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:50","2025-11-25 14:02:42","","","","","19","","Energy.

However, network congestion, communication failures, cyber-attacks and equipment malfunctions can introduce missing values and outliers, leading to anomalies that are captured at Phasor Data Concentrators (PDCs). Such anomalies can potentially degrade the performance of an estimator and consequently lead to power system stability issues. To address this issue, a newly introduced method integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Imputation Networks (GIN) with TLS-ESPRIT has been developed. The reliability of this integrated approach is confirmed through Monte Carlo simulations performed on signals with different oscillation modes and noise levels. These simulations highlight that combining GCN for outlier detection, GIN for data imputation, and TLS-ESPRIT for mode estimation surpasses conventional methods, particularly in the presence of significant data anomalies. The combination of GCN and GIN, along with the TLS-ESPRIT algorithm, presents a robust approach to overcoming the challenges associated with nonlinear data in PMU measurements. This technique ensures accurate mode estimation, thereby improving system stability and sustainability.

First, an input feature matrix representing the power system operation state is constructed based on the system's topological information and electrical measurements at each bus, which helps effectively capture the spatiotemporal evolution of post-fault transient voltages. Then, to mitigate the smoothing effects caused by spatiotemporal graph convolution learning, residual convolution is introduced to preserve the original features, thereby inferring the mapping relationship between spatiotemporal features and transient voltage stability status for accurate assessment.

However, although these modernized grids make the process very efficient and reliable, at the same time, the increased vulnerability to cyberattacks makes the need for Intrusion Detection Systems robust, as these infrastructures are critical ones. Traditional intrusion detection systems frequently tend to be inadequate in managing the intricacy and continually evolving nature of threats associated with smart grids. This paper presents a streamlined deep-learning approach for developing an IDS. The process involves the following: a) Data Collection: DNP3 is widely used in most CIs across the United States for industrial communication protocol. It permits remote access between ICS and SCADA systems. b) Preprocessing using Encoding and Normalisation techniques to avoid anomalies and noises from the raw dataset, c) Feature Extraction for extracting features of the smart grid using Autoencoder, and d) Detection using Graphical Convolutional Network (GCN). GCN-based IDS demonstrates superior potential in identifying sophisticated cyber threats, ensuring real-time detection, and maintaining the integrity and reliability of smart grids.

Given a budget to be allocated over a certain time horizon, we formulate the joint spatio-temporal CSs and DGs planning problem as a multi-objective optimization problem. During each planning period, the allocation strategy aims at minimizing the total power generation costs and CSs/DGs installation costs while satisfying budgetary and power constraints and ensuring a minimum level for the charging requests satisfaction rate. In this regard, we first predict the future power demand of EVs using a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN). Then, using the power demand forecast, we obtain the optimal number and locations of CSs and DGs at each time stage using reinforcement learning. A case study of the proposed allocation strategy over 6 time stages for the 2000-bus power grid of Texas coupled with 720 initially existing CSs is presented to illustrate the performance of the planning strategy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:51","2025-11-26 08:19:45","","4528-4542","","4","26","","IEEE Trans.

While graph neural networks show promise for this task, existing methods often neglect the long-tailed distribution inherent in real-world grid fault data and fail to provide reliability estimates for their decisions. To address these dual challenges, we propose a novel multi-expert collaboration uncertainty-aware power fault recognition framework with cross-view graph learning. Its core innovations are two synergistic modules: (1) The infographics aggregation module tackles the long-tail problem by learning robust graph-level representations. It employs an information-driven optimization loss within a contrastive graph architecture, explicitly preserving global invariance and local structural information across diverse (including rare) fault states. This ensures balanced representation learning for both the head and tail classes. (2) The multi-expert reliable decision module addresses prediction uncertainty. It trains individual expert classifiers using the Dirichlet distribution to explicitly model the credibility (uncertainty) of each expert’s decision. Crucially, a complementary collaboration rule based on evidence theory dynamically integrates these experts. This rule generates active weights for expert participation, prioritizing more certain experts and fusing their evidence to produce a final decision with a quantifiable reliability estimate. Collaboratively, these modules enable reliable diagnosis under data imbalance: The Infographics Module provides discriminative representations for all fault types, especially tail classes, while the Multi-Expert Module leverages these representations to make decisions with explicit uncertainty quantification. This synergy significantly improves both the accuracy and the reliability of fault recognition, particularly for rare or ambiguous grid conditions. Ultimately, extensive experiment evaluations on the four datasets reveal that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the fault diagnosis of smart grids, in terms of accuracy, precision, f score and recall. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:51","2025-11-25 16:21:34","","5359-5376","","3","85","","Comput.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a wind power cluster forecasting model that integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with Dynamic Spatiotemporal Graphs (STG). The method utilizes wavelet transforms to extract multi-scale features from wind power signals, capturing both high-frequency fluctuations and low-frequency trends. Simultaneously, a spatiotemporal graph is constructed to uncover the spatiotemporal dependencies between wind turbines within a wind farm. Subsequently, a Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN) is employed to further mine these features, enabling accurate wind power prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms traditional methods such as GCN-LSTM, GATLSTM, and STGCN, particularly in terms of metrics such as MSE, MAE, and R2, achieving optimal performance and validating the model's effectiveness and robustness in improving the accuracy of wind power forecasting. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:51","2025-11-25 14:02:42","","2695-2700","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

In addition, the transition from traditional SG-dominated power systems to converter-dominated power systems has led to the emergence of higher order system models, placing higher computational requirements on real-time CS. To address the above-mentioned challenges, a Graphical-DeepONet is developed to predict transient dynamics trajectories of SGs and converters. Compared to the traditional time-domain simulation (TDS) requiring the iterative computation of differential–algebraic equations or the DL-based methods learn from the initial trajectory generated by TDS, the developed model is a TDS-independent solution, which learns to approximate the solution operators that map prefault measurements to the transient dynamics trajectories, thus significantly improving the computational efficiency. To learn the spatial–temporal features related to N-1 contingency, which leads to diverse system topologies, a graph neural network-aided branch net is designed to improve learning capability.

Increasing shares of distributed energy resources (e.g. renewable energy generators, electric vehicles) and internet-connected sensing and control devices (e.g. smart heating and cooling) require new tools to support accurate, data-driven decision making. Modelling the effect of such growing complexity in the electrical grid is possible in principle using state-of-the-art power-power flow models. In practice, the detailed information needed for these physical simulations may be unknown or prohibitively expensive to obtain. Hence, data-driven approaches to power systems modelling, including feed-forward neural networks and auto-encoders, have been studied to leverage the increasing availability of sensor data, but have seen limited practical adoption due to lack of transparency and inefficiencies on large-scale problems. Our work addresses this gap by proposing a data- and knowledge-driven probabilistic graphical model for energy systems based on the framework of graph neural networks (GNNs). The model can explicitly factor in domain knowledge, in the form of grid topology or physics constraints, thus resulting in sparser architectures and much smaller parameters dimensionality when compared with traditional machine-learning models with similar accuracy.

First, it uses a hybrid Transformer-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in the process for fault detection. This is because transformers will capture the long-range temporal dependencies by voltage and current data, while CNNs will extract localization fault features. This approach can achieve an estimated fault detection accuracy of 99.3% with a real-time latency of less than 50 ms. For fault localization, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) is employed for modeling the power grid as a graph, hence enabling learning of spatial dependencies between nodes. This approach achieves 97.80% accuracy in the detection of exact fault location and completes within 100 ms. Next, the classification of faults uses an RNN-LSTM network to overcome temporal dependencies in the evolving nature of fault signals. The model reaches 98.20% classification accuracy by completing within 120 ms, which signifies that the model could differentiate between various kinds of faults in real-time applications. This framework improves the accuracy and speed of the fault management process, which directly contributes to the resilience and reliability of the power transmission system, thus reducing downtime period and increasing operation efficiency. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:53","2025-11-25 14:02:53","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Int.

Most STLF models predominantly exploit temporal dependencies from historical data to predict future consumption. Nowadays, with the widespread deployment of smart meters, their data can contain spatiotemporal dependencies. In particular, their consumption data is not only correlated to historical values but also to the values of 'neighboring' smart meters. This new characteristic motivates researchers to explore and experiment with new models that can effectively integrate spatiotemporal interrelations to increase forecasting performance. Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) can leverage such interrelations by modeling relationships between smart meters as a graph and using these relationships as additional features to predict future energy consumption. While extensively studied in other spatiotemporal forecasting domains such as traffic, environments, or renewable energy generation, their application to load forecasting remains relatively unexplored, particularly in scenarios where the graph structure is not inherently available. This paper overviews the current literature focusing on STGNNs with application in STLF. Additionally, from a technical perspective, it also benchmarks selected STGNN models for STLF at the residential and aggregate levels. The results indicate that incorporating graph features can improve forecasting accuracy at the residential level; however, this effect is not reflected at the aggregate level. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:53","2025-11-25 14:02:42","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Kiel PowerTech, PowerTech","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/4U2JRVXG/Nguyen et al. - 2025 - Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks for Short-Term Load Forecasting Does a graph inferred from sma.pdf","","#done; Graph neural networks; graph neural network; Power; Electric power plant loads; Graphic methods; Short term load forecasting; Renewable energy; Smart meters; Graph structures; Spatio-temporal graphs; Historical data; Energy utilization; Electric load forecasting; Load forecasting model; Benchmarking; Housing; Spatio-temporal dependencies; Undirected graphs; Aggregates; Short-term Load Forecasting; spatiotemporal forecasting; Spatio-temporal forecasting; Benchmark; Future consumption; #forecasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Various economic dispatch and operation strategies are established to improve the power system resilience, such as fine selection of N-k contingencies and improving the power flow entropy. However, since the resilience indices, basically, are the value of expectation and calculated statistically with numerous failure samplings, the mathematical mapping relationship between system operating points and resilience indices cannot be expressed analytically. As a result, current methods cannot incorporate resilience indices directly into power system economic dispatch constraints and objectives. In other words, current methods can only enhance system resilience in an indirect fashion. In this paper, we propose a novel resilience-constrained economic dispatch (RCED) framework with graph convolutional network (GCN) which can formulate the resilience objective function and constraints for the optimization of specific resilience indices. The proposed RCED framework contains offline and online phases. In the offline phase, cascading failure simulations would evaluate system resilience indices and construct the training set. The mapping relationship between operating points and resilience indices is learned with GCN. Moreover, the proposed GCN is equivalently transformed into a set of analytical equations in mixed-integer linear form. In the online phase, considering system resilience requirements, the proposed RCED model with the corresponding resilience constraints and objectives is solved dynamically. Case studies show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed RCED method. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:54","2025-11-25 21:48:07","","","","","","","IEEE Trans Power Syst","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/HVQPRZNY/Wang et al. - 2025 - Resilience-Constrained Economic Dispatch With Graph Convolutional Network.pdf","","#done; Sampling; Convolutional networks; Graph convolutional network; Power; Convolution; Outages; graph convolutional network; Electric load dispatching; 'current; Mapping; Mapping relationships; Constrained optimization; System resiliences; Power system resilience; Electric power system economics; Economic Dispatch; Resilience index; resilience-constrained economic dispatch; Resilience-constrained economic dispatch; #optimization-control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional inspection approaches, primarily relying on manual patrols, periodic maintenance, and localized sensor monitoring, face significant challenges in addressing wide-area faults, sudden equipment failures, environmental variations, and the high randomness introduced by emerging loads such as new energy vehicle charging. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a fault prediction framework for transmission lines based on Graph Neural Network (GNN), leveraging the coordinated sensing capabilities of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). By integrating satellite remote sensing and UAV inspection data, a multimodal representation of transmission line structures is constructed. The GNN model then fuses spatially and temporally heterogeneous information to capture the spatiotemporal evolution patterns of faults. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves fault prediction accuracy and localization performance while reducing false alarm rates, offering both theoretical insights and practical value for condition monitoring and proactive maintenance in smart grids. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:54","2025-11-25 14:02:53","","3490-3494","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Int.

Meanwhile, integrating small-capacity battery energy storage systems into distribution network is a growing trend in the construction of virtual power plants (VPPs), which offer great potential advantages in improving the system frequency regulation capabilities. However, the process of power dispatch for VPPs may be hindered by imperfections in the communication network, which affects their frequency control performance. Simultaneously, the economic benefits associated with their frequency control services are often overlooked. As such, we propose a co-design method of power dispatch with dynamic power regulation and communication transmission optimization for frequency control in VPPs. First, a joint design scheme of power dispatch and routing optimization under cloud-edge collaborations is proposed. This scheme encompasses a power dispatch method considering the influences of communication network and a routing optimization policy based on graph convolutional neural networks, both of which are designed to ensure the accurate and real-time frequency control service. Further, we propose a dynamic power regulation strategy under edge-edge collaborations. Specifically, according to the established correction control objective, an adaptive distributed auction algorithm (ADAA) based dynamic power regulation control method is designed to determine the optimal regulation power of VPPs, thereby improving the economic benefits of frequency control service. Finally, the simulation results validate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed co-design method for frequency control. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:54","2025-11-26 09:22:59","","1383-1394","","4","13","","J.

Currently, the mainstream power flow algorithms utilize programming for power flow calculations. However, when faced with line faults or expansions and renovations, there is a need to re-iterate calculations using a large amount of data. First, with the aim of improving the speed of power flow calculations and simplifying the process of power flow calculations after adjustments to the power system structure, the emerging technology of graph databases is highly compatible with power grid topologies. Under the condition that data for various parts of the power grid and their relationships are known, graph databases and related theories can be used to build graph models, and graph computing theories can be applied to optimize the power flow calculation process, thereby accelerating the calculation. Secondly, graph database-based power flow calculations belong to parallel computing, whereas traditional power flow calculations are serial computations. In theory, parallel computing is faster than serial computing. By comparing traditional power flow calculations with graph database-based power flow calculations, the speed advantages of using graph databases in power flow calculations can be established. Finally, due to the rise of artificial intelligence, this paper also explores the use of graph neural networks for power flow calculations in power grids, concluding that using graph neural networks for training can yield accurate power flow calculation results. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:54","2025-11-25 16:21:29","","527-532","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Int.

The proposed method is centered around DCAI (Data-Driven Computational Intelligence) technology, which is capable of sensitively capturing the impact of multiple compound weather conditions on power grid load loss and identifying the optimal reinforcement schemes. The method consists of three main components: (1)constructing a comprehensive meteorological intensity index based on compound weather conditions; (2) establishing a spatiotemporal mapping relationship between weather and line faults using Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) interpolation and the Haversine distance formula; (3)developing a spatiotemporal graph neural network (ST-GNN) with physical constraints, which employs spatial encoding, temporal encoding, and physical constraint layers to build the mapping relationship between line faults and load loss. Additionally, a robust optimization model considering both reinforcement cost and safe operation constraints is established, with adversarial tests conducted under regional attacks, moving storms, and multi-pulse attacks.

These DER in-turn are susceptible to increasing cyber threats. An adversary can plug into the same local network that a field photovoltaic (PV) system uses to interconnect its data loggers and inverters and manipulate certain measurements collected from the network or trick existing irradiance and inverter readings through false data injection attacks (FDIA). Control routines that rely on these measurements can propagate the false data, impacting critical decisions that result in a suboptimal operation or even cause intentional harm leading to inverter-tripping or unscheduled loads that need to be shed. To detect FDIA in PV systems, the paper introduces an attention-based graph neural network with node embeddings and applied it to a simple prototypical DC-coupled microgrid with PV, energy storage, and load. The algorithm shows a detection accuracy of up to 98.95%. The proposed FDIA detection technique will provide micro-grid operators with an effective method to safeguard their systems, guaranteeing the secure and reliable operation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:55","2025-11-26 09:22:05","","85-90","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Computer Society","","English","","","Scopus","","","","0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-11-26] Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Int.

In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end deep network, named hierarchical graph network with adaptive reconciliation (HiGN-ARec), to predict the PV power for all levels. Specifically, HiGN-ARec consists of two parts: the base forecasts and the reconciliation. For the base forecasts, we adopt the state-of-the-art spatio-temporal (ST) modules to exploit the intralevel information and propose interaction modules to capture the valuable inter-level information. The cooperation of both modules in the base forecasts contributes to the significant enhancement of the accuracy of base forecasts. For the reconciliation, we propose a reconciliation matrix P which is used to adjust the base forecasts and aggregation matrix S to impose the consistency constraint on the network. The reconciliation matrix P is learnable and determined with other parameters in the network via training. It incorporates knowledge about hierarchy structure and learned parameters that adjust base forecasts effectively. We use synthetic solar PV power plant data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over the competing methods. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:55","2025-11-25 14:02:42","","","","","","","IEEE Trans.

However, different types load within a region usually exhibit different variation patterns in short-term time scale. Existing forecasting methods mostly ignore the differentiated load characteristics and the interrelationships among various loads, solely focus on the overall trend of changes. Graph neural network (GNN) provides a way to consider the correlation of various types of loads when establishing load forecasting model, but it still has two major problems: 1) the predefined adjacency matrix is difficult to fully and accurately represent the correlation of different industry loads; 2) the graph convolution operation is difficult to take into account the different time series variation patterns of various loads. To this end, a regional load forecasting approach based on multi-channel fusion and adaptive graph neural networks (MC-ADAGNN) is proposed, which is designed for regional power grids with various load types. Firstly, multiple feature extraction channels including Skeleton-Foundation, Dynamic-Interaction, and Core-Stability are fused to build a graph construction layer, which can adaptively generate the adjacency matrix to extract the correlative features of different types of load nodes. Secondly, considering the different scales periodic variation of different loads, a convolution module including multi-hop propagation layer and inception-dilated convolution is constructed, speeding up the information transfer efficiency and adaptively selecting the convolution kernel size to learn multi-scale features. Finally, the features output by the convolution module are passed through the output layer to give the load forecasting results of each category, and they are summed to obtain the regional load. Simulation results based on the actual load data show that the MC-ADAGNN model has the best performance compared with other benchmarks, verifying the validity of the proposed approach. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:55","2025-11-25 14:02:42","","","","","","","IEEE Trans Ind Appl","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/KZSYDQ3E/Dai et al. - 2025 - A Regional Short-Term Load Forecasting Approach Based on Multi-Channel Fusion and Adaptive Graph Neu.pdf","","#done; Graph neural networks; Graph neural network; Load forecasting; Convolution; Electric power plant loads; Graph theory; Electric load forecasting; Benchmarking; Network layers; Matrix algebra; Graph construction; Inception layer; Multi channel; adaptive graph construction; Adaptive graph construction; adaptive kernel size selection; Adaptive kernel size selection; Adaptive kernels; inception layer; Kernel size; mix-hop; Mix-hop; multi-channel fusion; Multi-channel fusion; short-term regional load forecasting; Short-term regional load forecasting; Size selection; #forecasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, it is necessary to consider the extreme operating conditions (EOCs) of the systems during the setting calculation. Traditional EOC Search (EOCS) methods based on local enumeration are time-consuming and have high computational overheads, which cannot meet the requirement of the new-type power system. This paper proposes a Multi-Action Reinforcement Learning Method and Multi-Action Exploration Strategy to solve the EOCS problems. The algorithm optimizes the traditional reinforcement learning framework by exploring several actions with the highest value in each state, thereby accelerating the convergence of the neural network. The proposed methods are verified on the IEEE 39-bus system. The experimental results show that the Multi-Action Reinforcement Learning Method can effectively solve the EOCS problem.

The uncertainty of renewable energy makes the operational state of power systems more complex and variable, rendering traditional analysis methods inadequate for accurately assessing the transient stability of power systems. To address this, this paper adopts a graph convolutional neural network (GCN) model enhanced with a Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention mechanism (SE-GCN). This model explicitly considers the influence of network topology by embedding the grid's topological structure, enabling deep feature extraction and learning on the graph, thereby improving assessment accuracy. The proposed method is validated using the IEEE-68 bus test system.

Accurate and timely TSA is essential for the reliable execution of generator tripping schemes. This paper proposes a novel framework for transient stability evaluation and emergency generator tripping based on spatiotemporal graph deep learning. A wide-area transient response feature is constructed using a structure-preserving transient energy function, and the resulting feature sequences are modeled as spatiotemporal graphs. A hybrid model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) is developed to perform TSA and predict coherent generator clusters. The CNN module captures temporal dependencies, while the GAT module learns spatial relationships across the power network. Based on the predicted coherency clusters, a generator tripping scheme is derived using the one-machine infinite-bus (OMIB) equivalence method. Compared with previous work [1], which applied graph learning for coherency identification, our method further integrates temporal dynamics into both TSA and emergency control using an end-to-end spatiotemporal learning framework.

However, the diagnostic accuracy of current fault diagnosis methods is limited due to the single source of training data and the imbalanced fault categories. This article proposes a fault diagnosis algorithm based on ambient signals and graph convolutional networks (GCNs), approaching from two perspectives, broadening the input information sources and enhancing feature distinguishability to address this issue. First, this algorithm constructs a GCN adjacency matrix from system topology and enhances fault information by incorporating ambient signals derived from small disturbances during normal conditions. The fault and ambient signals are then decomposed into various intrinsic modes, serving as inputs of the diagnostic model to extract system information embedded in nonfault signals, thus achieving information increment. Subsequently, building upon the GCN architecture, the holistic capture GCN (HCGCN) is developed by integrating spatiotemporal attention mechanisms and integrative pyramid networks across temporal, spatial, and feature dimensions. This enables iterative updating of adjacency matrix weights and full-dimensional feature extraction. Finally, an imbalanced fault set is constructed based on practical operating conditions for comparative and ablation experiments to validate the proposed method. Various communication fault scenarios are also considered to test the method’s accuracy and robustness. The diagnostic accuracy up to 99.17% under no communication fault condition and 98.22% under communication fault demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves line short-circuit fault diagnosis performance in power systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:55","2025-11-25 14:02:53","","","","","74","","IEEE Trans.

Yet, the intricate and evolving relationships among load sequences and various external variables (e.g., temperature, electricity cost) present major difficulties in multivariate modeling. Existing graph-based forecasting models typically construct graphs based on variables or time points, but often neglect local spatio-temporal patterns, making it difficult to capture rapid feature variations within short time windows. Moreover, due to the multi-periodic nature of load sequences, their correlations with external features vary across time scales, further reducing forecasting accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multi-scale Dynamic Patch Graph Neural Network (MDPGNN). In the local channel, the model constructs patch-level graphs and integrates dynamic graph learning with adaptive graph convolution to jointly model the internal structure of load sequences and their multi-scale dependencies with external features. In the global channel, a global correlation graph is designed to preserve long-range temporal patterns and inter-variable relationships. Furthermore, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism is employed to effectively fuse multi-scale dependencies and the outputs of both local and global channels. Experimental results on two real-world load datasets show that MDPGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNN-based models in terms of prediction accuracy and stability. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:55","2025-11-25 14:02:42","","168287-168304","","","13","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/MJ4YBJ9K/Zhu et al. - 2025 - Connecting the Patches Exploring Multi-Scale Relations in Patches via Graph Neural Networks for Sho.pdf","","#done; Graph neural networks; Convolution; Electric power plant loads; Graph theory; Graphic methods; Graph structures; Electric load forecasting; Dynamics; Graph construction; Features fusions; Multi-scale features; Mixture of experts; adaptive graph convolution; Adaptive graph convolution; dynamic patch-level graph construction; Dynamic patch-level graph construction; Level graphs; Mixture-of-expert strategy; mixture-of-experts strategy; multi-scale feature fusion; Multi-scale feature fusion; Short-term electricity load forecasting; #forecasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current WFCPP modeling method ignores the important role of wind direction and frequency domain information, resulting in insufficient use of spatial information and difficult to improve the prediction accuracy. In order to solve the above problems, a day-ahead power prediction model for wind farm cluster power is proposed based on information gain in frequency domain and dynamic trend sensing. Firstly, a cluster division method based on graph theory and progressive fusion of multiple information is proposed, and a virtual information node is set up. Secondly, a method to identify prevailing wind direction under time window is proposed for subsets, and a dynamic weighted directed graph structure is designed based on prevailing wind direction and wind speed. Thirdly, a dynamic spatio-temporal graph convolutional network model with frequency domain gain channel attention mechanism (FDCA-DSTGCN) is proposed to integrate the above information and complete the prediction. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a wind farm cluster in Inner Mongolia of China.

Accurately and efficiently assessing the state of these networks is crucial for ensuring the safe, stable, and economical operation of power systems. Conventional methods for calculating the state of distribution networks typically rely on physical models of the power system. These approaches involve extensive mathematical computations and simulation analyses, making it challenging to meet the real-time requirements of modern power systems. To tackle this problem, this paper presents an innovative approach for calculating the state of distribution networks, which is grounded in heterogeneous graph mask modeling. The proposed method employs a heterogeneous graph neural network to model the distribution network, mapping its nodes and edges to corresponding elements within the graph structure. It then uses graph mask technology to reconstruct node attributes and edges through self-supervised mechanisms. Leveraging a pre-trained graph neural network model, the state of the distribution network can be computed rapidly and precisely.

The increasing number of devices connected to the system has led to more complex characteristics and forms of load, which has brought considerable difficulties to the relevant methods in achieving higher load prediction accuracy and reliability. In this regard, this study proposes a deep learning model that combines graph convolutional network (GCN), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and dendritic neural model (DNM) to forecast electric load more accurately. Firstly, the sample load data is constructed into graph data with individual time steps as nodes. A GCN is used to extract the hidden features while allowing a full communication between the time steps feature data. A GRU is then used to capture the time-dependent relationship of the data. Finally, a dendritic layer instead of a fully connected layer is used as the output to integrate data features in depth. Experiments are conducted to verify the validity of the proposed model and compared it with several effective deep learning models, including CNN_LSTM, Transformer and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN). The results show a significant improvement in prediction compared to the baseline models, with mean absolute percentage error(MAPE) of 1.62% and 3.98%, coefficient of determination(R2) of 0.983 and 0.928 respectively on two load datasets at different levels of aggregation, nationally and regionally. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:56","2025-11-25 14:02:42","","3221-3233","","4","12","","IEEE Trans.

Traditional mathematical optimization algorithms tend to encounter issues like slow computational speed and difficulties in solving large-scale models, while heuristic algorithms are prone to fall into local optima. Furthermore, few scholars in the existing research on distribution network (DN) reconfiguration have considered the graph structure information, resulting in the loss of critical topological information and limiting the effect of optimization. Therefore, this paper proposes an ADNDR approach based on the graph convolutional network deep deterministic policy gradient (GCNDDPG). Firstly, a nonlinear stochastic optimization mathematical model for the ADNDR is constructed, taking into account the uncertainty of sources and loads. Secondly, a loop-based encoding method is employed to reduce the action space and complexity of the ADNDR. Then, based on graph theory, the DN structure is transformed into a dynamic network graph model, and a GCNDDPG-based ADNDR approach is proposed for the solution. In this method, graph convolutional networks are used to extract features from the graph structure information, and the state of the DN, and the deep deterministic policy gradient is utilized to optimize the ADNDR decision-making process to achieve the safe, stable, and economic operation of the DN. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified on an improved IEEE 33-bus power system.

To address this, a novel forecasting approach using a multi-task spatio-temporal fusion network is presented.

Firstly, an index system for WPRE characterization is developed, including metrics such as power change rate and duration. Based on this, an X-means classification method for WPRE is established. Secondly, a spatio-temporal encoder combining graph convolutional networks and temporal attention mechanisms has been proposed to model the spatiotemporal dependencies of meteorological changes in offshore wind farms. Finally, a multitask learning framework has been introduced to predict WPRE characteristic indices and occurrence probabilities.

Under-voltage load shedding is a popular and effective approach for emergency control. However, with the increasing complexity and scale of power systems and the rise in uncertainty factors, traditional approaches struggle with computation speed, accuracy, and scalability issues. Deep reinforcement learning holds significant potential for the power system decision-making problems. However, existing deep reinforcement learning algorithms have limitations in effectively leveraging diverse operational features, which affects the reliability and efficiency of emergency control strategies. This paper presents an innovative approach for real-time emergency voltage control strategies for transient stability enhancement through the integration of edge-graph convolutional networks with reinforcement learning. This method transforms the traditional emergency control optimization problem into a sequential decision-making process.

There may be a problem with the implementing blockchain technology which may be a problem of scalability that can result in narrow space in providing services for multiple similar activities at different EV places at anyone time thus slowing down the rate of charging. This paper proposes a hybrid method for a flexible and secure smart charging system that combines blockchain technology with advanced techniques. The proposed method is the combined execution of together Namib beetle optimization algorithm (NBOA) and Continual Spatio- Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (CSTGCN). Henceforth, it is called as NBOA-CSTGCN method. The objective of the proposed technique is to improve the efficiency and stability of EV charging systems. The NBOA is utilized to optimize EV charging schedules, ensuring a balanced load on the power grid. The CSTGCN is employed to predict and adapt to dynamic energy demand, facilitating efficient energy distribution across charging stations. By then, the proposed method is realized in MATLAB platform and associated to various existing approaches for example Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Adaptive Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (ANSGA-II), Krill Herd Algorithm (KHA). The proposed NBOA-CSTGCN method achieves the highest efficiency of 92.1 %, outperforming PSO (70.5%), ANSGA-II (78.2%), and KHA (86.7%).

The purpose of this paper is to develop a distinct and smart energy prediction system for solar PV systems. An efficient Solar Synergistic Adversarial Energy Forecasting System (Solar-SAFS) has been developed, which greatly enhances the precision and reliability of solar power predictions. It combines various deep learning methods including Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively understand spatial and time-related patterns in solar data. The strength and accuracy of this model are increased by using adversarial training, which makes sure it gives reliable predictions in different situations. For making the hyper parameters better and to increase model's effectiveness and efficiency, we are using Grey-Oystercatcher Hybrid Optimization (GOHO) technique.

Using multi-dimensional data such as power equipment operation status, user load characteristics, and meteorological conditions, a fusion algorithm is designed to improve the accuracy of anomaly detection and the scientific nature of root cause analysis. Through data preprocessing and feature extraction methods, a multi-source data fusion framework is constructed to ensure the spatiotemporal consistency between different data sources. Then, this paper proposes an adaptive weighted data fusion algorithm (AWDF) to dynamically adjust the weights of different data sources in anomaly detection, so that the model can more accurately capture the main influencing factors of line loss anomalies. Subsequently, combined with graph neural network (GNN) and anomaly detection algorithm, intelligent recognition of abnormal data is realized, and the possible root causes of abnormal line loss in substations are derived through Bayesian reasoning.

However, with the increasing size and complexity of power grids, traditional power grid state estimation methods face significant challenges in reducing estimation errors and improving model accuracy due to that they neglect the correlation and varying degrees of influence among nodes in the power grid. To address this issue, this paper proposes a topology-aware power grid state estimation method (TPGSE), which combines a multihead self-attention mechanism with message passing graph neural networks. The topological structure of the power grid is naturally considered as a graph model. An anomaly detection mechanism is utilized to identify and handle abnormal data, followed by the imputation of missing node and edge features. Then, a message passing graph neural network with a multi-head self-attention mechanism is employed to aggregate the features of nodes and edges, capturing the latent relationships between them. Finally, a shared-parameter fully connected layer is used to independently handle the prediction tasks for each node. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accurate state estimation and prediction, exhibiting strong generalization and robustness across complex power grid topologies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:57","2025-11-25 14:02:46","","760-765","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Int.

However, conventional numerical methods for AC-OPF face challenges such as high computational costs and convergence difficulties as system size increases. To address these challenges, existing research utilizes direct current OPF (DC-OPF) or data-driven methods. DC-OPF linearizes the AC-OPF problem by considering inherent physical characteristics of the power system, such as voltage variations, providing an approximate solution. Meanwhile, data-driven methods leverage its strong end-to-end learning capabilities to solve AC-OPF effectively. Although both methods are sufficiently fast, DC-OPF can suffer from accuracy limitations due to its simplifying assumptions, which neglect reactive power and voltage deviations. On the other hand, data-driven approaches may exhibit degraded performance when trained on limited data and are prone to constraint violations. To address these problems, this study proposes PrOPF, a physics-informed framework that refines DC solutions to solve AC-OPF. Instead of learning from scratch, PrOPF treats DC-OPF results as physical priors and learns the mapping from DC to AC solutions using a graph neural network. A physics-informed loss with soft constraints is introduced during training, and hard constraints are enforced during inference to improve physical consistency. Extensive simulations are conducted on various IEEE test systems with renewable energy. The results demonstrate that our PrOPF achieves higher prediction accuracy and lower constraint violations compared to other data-driven OPF methods, and attains up to 30x acceleration over the traditional interior point method. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:57","2025-11-26 09:22:03","","","","","","","IEEE Trans Power Syst","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-11-26] Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/LKTSRAWV/Liu et al. - 2025 - A Physics-Informed Graph Convolution Network for AC Optimal Power Flow Via Refining DC Solution.pdf","","#done; Graph neural networks; Neural-networks; Power flows; Electric load flow; Convolution; Renewable energy; Numerical methods; Flow graphs; Optimal power flows; Optimization; Graph convolution network; Data-driven analysis; Direct-current; graph convolution network; Optimal power flow; Alternating current; Physic-informed neural network; physics-informed neural network; Data flow analysis; Problem solving; data-driven analysis; limited data; Limited data; Power flow constraint; power flow constraints; #optimization-control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, as modern power systems become increasingly complex, the challenges of short-term load forecasting are also intensifying. To address this challenge, data-driven deep learning techniques and load aggregation technologies have gradually been introduced into the field of load forecasting. However, data quality issues persist due to various factors such as sensor failures, unstable communication, and susceptibility to network attacks, leading to data gaps. Furthermore, in the domain of aggregated load forecasting, considering the potential interactions among aggregated loads can help market participants engage in cross-market transactions. However, aggregated loads often lack clear geographical locations, making it difficult to predefine graph structures. To address the issue of data quality, this study proposes a model named adversarial graph convolutional imputation network (AGCIN), combined with local and global correlations for imputation. To tackle the problem of the difficulty in predefining graph structures for aggregated loads, this study proposes a learnable adjacency matrix, which generates an adaptive adjacency matrix based on the relationships between different sequences without the need for geographical information. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed imputation method outperforms other imputation methods in scenarios with random and continuous missing data. Additionally, the prediction accuracy of the proposed method exceeds that of several baseline methods, affirming the effectiveness of our approach in imputation and prediction, ultimately enhancing the accuracy of aggregated load forecasting. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-17 18:58:57","2025-11-25 14:02:42","","","","18","17","","Energies","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/N8KTYDBE/Zhao et al. - 2024 - Enhancing Aggregate Load Forecasting Accuracy with Adversarial Graph Convolutional Imputation Networ.pdf","","#done; Convolutional neural networks; Convolutional neural network; Load forecasting; Spatiotemporal correlation; graph convolutional neural network; Adjacency matrix; Generative adversarial networks; spatio-temporal correlation; Aggregate load; data imputation; aggregate load forecasting; Aggregate load forecasting; Data imputation; Data quality; learnable adjacency matrix; Learnable adjacency matrix; Market participants; #forecasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Firstly, by constructing the graph of transmission lines, it is able to integrate the line equipment and their relationship information with each other, and store various information of transmission lines, such as the geographic information of the lines, the equipment models, and the operation status, etc., in the form of a graph database. Secondly, the graph database is utilized in combination with graph convolutional network to construct a graph convolutional network based on the graph spectrum to quickly locate fault points. Finally, by analyzing the operating status, maintenance history and other information of the line equipment, the possible fault time and fault type of the equipment can be predicted, so that corresponding maintenance measures can be taken in advance to avoid the occurrence of faults.

In this article, we propose a cloud-edge-end collaboration approach to quantify the aggregated uncertainty of power generation from multi spatial-temporal DERs. First, considering the temporal dynamic and electrical topology correlation of DERs, a local uncertainty aggregation model based on a spatial-temporal graph neural network (STGNN) is developed. This model can effectively extract the spatial-temporal characteristics of data. Second, addressing the data silo problem caused by the unwillingness of various stakeholders managing the DERs to share data due to privacy concerns, an uncertainty aggregation model training mechanism based on an adaptive secure federated learning is proposed. This mechanism enables collaborative modeling of uncertainty aggregation models across stakeholders while preserving user privacy. In addition, it improves the quality of local model training by adaptively extracting parameter information from the global model for local model initialization. Moreover, since the probability distribution of the aggregated uncertainty is unknown, this article combines STGNN with the weighted quantile regression model to characterize the aggregated uncertainty without prior assumptions about the distribution, and by assigning differentiated weights to aggregation results under different confidence levels based on their importance, the proposed method can better meet the diverse needs of power grid.

This makes the development of intelligent systems for automatic fault detection, classification, localization, and network reconfiguration highly relevant. The aim of this study is to develop an automatic switching algorithm for urban power networks using artificial intelligence methods, particularly a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network, combined with graph-based approaches for modeling the grid structure and identifying alternative energy supply routes. The research was carried out using MATLAB, Simulink, Power Systems Toolbox, and Deep Learning Toolbox. The simulation model represents a section of an urban grid consisting of 3 substations, 8 switches, 20 consumers, and a corresponding weighted graph. Fault diagnosis is per-formed using an MLP neural network with 64 input features, three hidden layers [128, 64, 32], and a softmax output layer for classifying different types of faults. The network reconfiguration algorithm considers power flow direction, line capacity, load constraints, and seeks to minimize the number of switching operations. Alternative supply paths are generated via heuristic graph search while accounting for load priority. Simulation results demonstrate the high efficiency of the proposed approach. On average, dam-aged areas can be isolated with only 2–3 switching operations, restoring power to 90–92% of consumers without causing overloads in other parts of the network. The neural network achieved a classification accuracy of 96.3%, enabling real-time supervisory control and data acquisition system command generation. The practical value of the solution enabling seamless integration into existing Smart Grid systems and lies in its applicability for integration into existing Smart Grid infrastructures without requiring major system modifications. Prospects for further research include extending the model to consider dynamic load profiles, asymmetric operating conditions, limitations from renewable energy sources, and the introduction of economic criteria for switching optimization and decision-making under uncertainty. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:57","2025-11-25 21:48:14","","376-393","","20","1","","Int.

Effective prediction of PV power can improve new energy consumption capacity, help power system planning, promote development of smart grids, and ultimately support construction of smart energy cities. However, different from centralized PV power forecasts, three critical challenges are encountered in distributed PV power forecasting: 1) lack of on-site meteorological observation, 2) leveraging extraneous data to enhance forecasting performance, 3) spatial-temporal modelling methods of meteorological information around the distributed PV stations. To address these issues, we propose a Graph Spatial-Temporal Attention Neural Network (GSTANN) to predict the very short-term power of distributed PV. First, we use satellite remote sensing data covering a specific geographical area to supplement meteorological information for all PV stations. Then, we apply the graph convolution block to model the non-Euclidean local and global spatial dependence and design an attention mechanism to simultaneously derive temporal and spatial correlations. Subsequently, we propose a data fusion module to solve the time misalignment between satellite remote sensing data and surrounding measured on-site data and design a power approximation block to map the conversion from solar irradiance to PV power.

However, most of the existing customer-level load forecasting methods utilize the temporal correlation of historical load sequences to construct a data-driven model, while ignoring the potential spatial correlation that exists between the electricity consumption behaviors of neighboring customers. Therefore, a residential customer cluster load forecasting method based on DBSCAN clustering and adaptive spatio-temporal synchronization map convolutional neural network is proposed. First, DBSCAN clustering is used to divide the residential clusters into different groups according to the similarity of electricity use behavior; then, based on the number of subgroups in the residential clusters, the historical load data of the residential users in each group, and the correlation between the load sequences of the residential users in each group, spatio-temporal maps are constructed for the load prediction of the residential clusters; and finally, adaptive spatiotemporal synchronization map convolutional neural network is used to achieve the medium- and long-term load prediction of the residential clusters. Finally, an adaptive spatiotemporal synchronization map convolutional neural network is used to realize medium- and long-term load forecasting for residential user clusters. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method are tested and verified by the open data set of residential loads, and the experimental results show that the proposed method can fully exploit and utilize the spatio-temporal correlation between different residential loads to improve the accuracy of residential load forecasting compared with the benchmark forecasting methods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-17 18:58:57","2025-11-25 14:02:42","","2030-2034","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Int.

The system encounters difficulties in reducing total EV charging and discharging plan costs while maintaining high operational efficiency and power grid integrity throughout varying electrical circumstances. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a hybrid approach for optimized V2G control system. The proposed method integrates the Osprey Optimization Algorithm (OOA) and Position-Aware Graph Neural Network (PAGNN); therefore it is called the OOA-PAGNN technique. The main goal is to reduce total costs, enhance grid stability, and generate revenue for EV owners through an optimized V2G framework. OOA is utilized to optimize the charging and discharging schedules of EVs, ensuring effective energy flow management and enhancing grid stability. While, PAGNN is utilized to predict energy demand and generation by analyzing the spatial distribution of EVs, enabling optimized energy allocation. By then, the proposed method is implemented on the MATLAB platform and evaluated with various existing approaches such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP), Particle Swarm Optimization-Trained Artificial Neural Network (PSO-TANN), Recurrent Proximal Policy Optimization-Long Short-Term Memory (RPPO-LSTM) and Competitive Swarm Optimization-Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (CSO-ICA).

Most Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) currently rely on signature-based and rule-based methods, which are ineffective against evolving threats such as False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA) and Denial-Of-Service (DoS) attacks. To address this, we propose an adaptive and intelligent cybersecurity framework leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for spatial analysis and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for temporal sequence detection. The model processes real-time network traffic, identifies anomalies based on graph structure changes in sequential attacks, and enhances the speed of cybersecurity response. Performance evaluation using the NSL-KDD dataset with synthetic FDIA and DoS attack patterns demonstrates a detection accuracy of 94.3%, a false positive rate of 3.2%, and a detection latency of only 180 ms, outperforming traditional IDS, which have an average latency of 450ms. Additionally, the integration of Explainable AI (XAI) using SHAP values improves model interpretability, enabling security analysts to validate detections efficiently.

After large disturbances, power systems may experience transient rotor angle instability and short-term voltage instability, which share similar electrical characteristics but require different control strategies. Therefore, distinguishing the dominant instability mode (DIM) is crucial. In this paper, a novel hybrid deep learning (DL) framework is proposed to achieve accurate DIM identification by fully extracting local-global features from electricity data. In the proposed framework, an advanced graph neural network (GNN) optimized by random sampling and aggregation is constructed. It can better capture local features than traditional GNN and help to improve model generalization ability. Further, important global features are mined by employing transformer network with self-attention mechanism to improve DIM identification accuracy. In addition, the vital discrete fault features are also embedded into the neural networks to improve the performance. The proposed method improves upon existing DL models by providing a solution for integrating multi-level features extracted by different schemes and addressing the limitation of focusing on a single instability mode.

However, capturing the time dependencies of grid power based on augmented data is crucial for ensuring timely and sensitive monitoring. In this research, propose a Multi-Channel Convolutional Neural Network (MCCNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to integrate and maintain balanced standards of signals, current, and voltage. Feature fusion using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) identifies relevant features or characteristics from the data analysis that indicate safety-related events or anomalies in the grid.

The large-scale integration of distributed energy has greatly increased the uncertainty of the operation of the distribution network itself, posing higher requirements for the planning, scheduling, and operation and maintenance management of the distribution network. Accurate distribution network topology as the foundation for analysis functions such as power flow calculation, fault location, and state estimation in distribution networks, and are also a prerequisite for carrying out power grid planning, operation, and scheduling work. Therefore, studying the topology identification methods of distribution networks is of great significance. In response to the problems of low identification accuracy and poor real-time performance in existing power grid topology identification methods, this paper proposes a distribution network topology identification method based on graph convolutional networks. Firstly, convert the topology of the distribution network into a point line diagram. Then, based on the node features of the distribution network topology, edge features of the distribution network lines are extracted as node features of the line graph. Furthermore, by utilizing the adjacency matrix of the abstract line graph and node features, a graph convolutional network is trained to obtain a distribution network topology identification model.

However, substation equipment is particularly vulnerable to seismic events due to the use of brittle porcelain materials and highly slender structures, increasing the risk of structural failure and cascading effects. While significant research has focused on seismic performance and innovative damping techniques for different standalone equipment, critical gaps remain, particularly in accounting for the interconnected nature of substation equipment and post-earthquake emergency response. This study addresses these gaps by proposing a hybrid post-earthquake rapid assessment model that utilizes monitored ground motion signals. Hybrid modeling combines physics-based models with data-driven approaches, leveraging the strengths of both to overcome their individual limitations. Specifically, the study integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNN) with mechanistic models of standalone equipment to capture the dynamic behavior and interaction forces of interconnected equipment under seismic loads. The spatial relationships of the interconnected equipment are represented through a graph structure, and temporal dependencies are learned through recurrent computations. Thus, this approach circumvents the need for costly and impractical sensor installations on every piece of equipment, offering a cost-effective and accurate assessment method. The efficacy of the proposed hybrid modelling technique is demonstrated with a case study on combinations of 800 kV post insulators interconnected by busbars. By providing a rapid assessment of each equipment's post-earthquake condition, the proposed model can be applied to inform emergency repair actions and enhance the resilience of power infrastructure. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:58","2025-11-25 21:48:14","","52-60","","","50","","","","","","","","Association of American Publishers","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Mater.

Based on the PPO algorithm, this paper designs and implements an improved intelligent ticketing system. This paper introduces a graph neural network (GNN) to model the power grid topology, so that the system can dynamically generate operation tickets based on the multi-dimensional state of the power grid. Combined with the exploratory and adaptive nature of the PPO algorithm, it autonomously learns and optimizes the process of generating operation tickets under a changing dispatching environment to reduce the risk of misoperation. In the load experiment, the dispatch success rate of the PPO algorithm under low and medium loads reached 96.5% and 95.3% respectively, maintaining a fast response; under high load, the success rate dropped slightly to 91.8%, but it can still meet the real-time requirements. The fault experiment shows that the success rate of PPO is 98.2% in single-point failures and slightly decreased to 92.5% in multi-point failures, but it has strong robustness.

The power network's transmission lines are primarily met with various faults. However, to maintain normal operation and minimize damage because of transmission line faults, it requires detecting and classifying faults. In this research, the Discrete Wavelet Transform-based Swish Recurrent Neural Network (DWT-SRNN) is proposed to detect and classify faults in power transmission lines using Deep Learning (DL). Initially, the data is acquired from the transmission line workspace by monitoring devices and sensors. Then, the Butterworth filtering is employed to increase the data quality. The DWT is performed to extract the features that transfer the time domain signal to the time-frequency signal during faulty and non-faulty conditions by decomposition. Finally, the SRNN is established to detect and classify faults in power transmission lines effectively. The existing techniques like Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN), Machine Learning (ML), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are compared with DWT-SRNN.

By introducing the proposed virtual node-splitting strategy, generator-level attributes like costs, limits, and ramp rates can be fully captured by GNN models, improving GNN's learning capacity and prediction accuracy. Optimal power flow (OPF) problem is used for real-time grid operations. Limited timeframe motivates studies to create size-reduced OPF (ROPF) models to relieve the computational complexity. In this paper, with virtual node-splitting, a novel two-stage adaptive hierarchical GNN is developed to (i) predict critical lines that would be congested, and then (ii) predict base generators that would operate at the maximum capacity. This will substantially reduce the constraints and variables needed for OPF, creating the proposed ROPFLG model with reduced monitor lines and reduced generator-specific variables and constraints. Two ROPF models, ROPFL and ROPFG, with just reduced lines or generators respectively, are also implemented as additional benchmark models. Case studies show that the proposed ROPFLG consistently outperforms the benchmark full OPF (FOPF) and the other two ROPF methods, achieving significant computational time savings while reliably finding optimal solutions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:58","2025-11-25 14:02:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Conf Rec IAS Annu Meet","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/NZ5L7YI3/Pham and Li - 2025 - Constraints and Variables Reduction for Optimal Power Flow Using Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks.pdf","","#done; Graph neural networks; Power flow; Power flows; Forecasting; Electric load flow; Learning systems; Machine-learning; Machine learning; Electric power transmission networks; Flow graphs; Electric generators; Optimal power flows; Optimization; Electric power transmission; Transmission network; Optimal power flow; Economic dispatch; Economic Dispatch; Hierarchical graphs; Hierarchical graph neural network; Node-splitting; Ramp generators; Split bus; Virtual node; #optimization-control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Conference Record - IAS Annual Meeting (IEEE Industry Applications Society)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper proposes a method for assessing the condition based on the graph convolutional network and transformer state panoramic information. The aim is to address the limitations of traditional equipment condition assessment models based on deep learning. Comprehensive state assessment models often fail to consider the correlation between state quantities, while models that do consider this correlation struggle to effectively incorporate unstructured descriptive data. The method enables an intelligent and differential evaluation of the transformer's operating status by using technical performance parameters, operating performance data, and external environment data in the equipment operation and maintenance knowledge graph. Unstructured information is effectively utilized through embedded coding. The correlation between state data is considered through the application of an adjacency matrix, allowing for explicit modeling of correlations in deep learning. This approach enhances feature interaction and information supplementation among state data, resulting in objective, accurate, and interpretable state evaluation results. Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy, ranging from 2.38% to 7.16%, when compared to the baseline models. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-17 18:58:58","2025-11-25 21:48:02","","2568-2573","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - Asia Conf.

They use large amounts of data to inform their actions and receive rewards or penalties as feedback to learn favorable responses for the system. Once trained, these agents can efficiently make decisions that would be too computationally complex for a human operator. This ability is especially valuable in decarbonizing power networks, where the demand for RL agents is increasing. These agents are well suited to control grid actions since the action space is constantly growing due to uncertainties in renewable generation, microgrid integration, and cybersecurity threats. To assess the efficacy of RL agents in response to an adverse grid event, we use the Grid2Op platform for agent training. We employ a proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm in conjunction with graph neural networks (GNNs). By simulating agents' responses to grid events, we assess their performance in avoiding grid failure for as long as possible. The performance of an agent is expressed concisely through its reward function, which helps the agent learn the most optimal ways to reconfigure a grid's topology amidst certain events. To model multi-actor scenarios that threaten modern power networks, particularly those resulting from cyberattacks, we integrate an opponent that acts iteratively against a given agent. This interplay between the RL agent and opponent is utilized in N-k contingency screening, providing a novel alternative to the traditional security assessment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:58:58","2025-11-25 21:27:29","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Tex.

Each of these domains are also susceptible to unwanted cascades, whether this be overloaded devices in the power grid or the reach of a social media post containing misinformation. The potential harm of a cascade is compounded when considering a malicious attack by an adversary that is intended to maximize the cascade impact. However, by exploiting knowledge of the cascading dynamics, targets with the largest cascading impact can be preemptively prioritized for defense, and the damage an adversary can inflict can be mitigated. While game theory provides tools for finding an optimal preemptive defense strategy, existing methods struggle to scale to the context of large graph environments because of the combinatorial explosion of possible actions with the size of the graph. Data-driven deep learning approaches can fill this gap, but they demand a large amount of data that is often costly to obtain. We propose a novel data generation approach for the cascading failure security problem that uses counterfactual data augmentation and a sub-game data querying strategy to generate both high quality and a high quantity of training data. We demonstrate that our data generation approach creates up to an order of magnitude more data than naïve querying with double the efficiency. We also introduce a deep learning model based embedding node pairs, and train it on our generated data, showing that it effectively defends from cascades on graphs as large as 1000 nodes. Our deep learning approach achieves a closer approximation to the Nash Equilibrium than existing heuristic methods, for graphs where the ground-truth equilibrium can be calculated. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-17 18:58:58","2025-11-25 21:32:41","","","","","258","","Expert Sys Appl","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/CNGVW4FR/Cunningham and Tucker - 2024 - Mitigating adversarial cascades in large graph environments.pdf","","#done; Graph neural networks; Graph Neural Networks; Deep learning; Cascading failures; Network theory (graphs); Graph structures; Graph embeddings; Learning approach; Heuristic methods; Cascading failure; Data generation; Electric grids; Communication grids; Game theory; Influence maximization; Influence maximizations; Large graphs; Network theory; #cybersecurity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the presence of these generators can lead to undesirable levels of voltage or current during transient angle instability. The current Lyapunov transient stability analysis method is challenging to utilize due to the complexity of acquiring the energy function. Furthermore, existing data-driven microgrid transient stability methods do not easily adapt to changes in topology. Inaccuracies may also be present in existing stability analysis methods, as they fail to account for nonlinearities such as saturation and dead zone. To address these issues, we propose a microgrid transient stability analysis method based on a message-passing graph neural network (MPNN). When the topology changes, the information bus and transmission line are aggregated and updated through the message-passing mechanism in the graph neural network, and we enhance the approach by introducing current saturation as an additional feature to the transient stability analysis model.

Neural power flow solvers provide a promising alternative, speeding up power flow computations by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude, though they are costly to train. In this paper, we envision how recently introduced grid foundation models could improve the economic viability of neural power flow solvers. Conceptually, these models amortize training costs by serving as a foundation for a range of grid operation and planning tasks beyond power flow solving, with only minimal fine-tuning required.

However, the challenges of processing multisource spatial-temporal data from different measurement systems remain unsolved, thus resulting in potentially biased results. In addition, most existing data-driven dynamic security assessment methods that focus on state estimation/prediction overlook the fault location identification, which is important to real-time decision-making. To address the above limitations, an advanced online dynamic security assessment, which learns system dynamics and fault characteristics from multisource spatial-temporal data, is developed. Considering the challenge posed by different sampling rates and sensor numbers, global and local spatial-temporal data from various measurement systems are modeled as graphs with different numbers of nodes and edges. Then, two different sets of graph neural networks are customized to learn global and local spatial-temporal features, respectively. With the learned multisource spatial-temporal features, a Fourier neural operator-based dynamics trajectory predictor and a multilayer perceptron-based fault location identifier are developed for the advanced online dynamic security assessment.

The power quality together with voltage stability suffers from changes in the conditions of the grid and the manner of EV charging. When AP and RP power coordination is not done properly it causes the grid to experience more stress and reduces the total system reliability. To overcome these drawbacks, this manuscript proposes technique for enhancing AP and RP control in three-phase grid connected EVs. The proposed method is named as Node Level Capsule Graph Neural Network (NCGNN).

However, the complex spatio-temporal property of power load makes it difficult to predict, which poses a great challenge to the power system. Existing spatio-temporal prediction methods can only handle one factor in each dimension of time and space. In reality, power load is influenced by various factors. Especially in terms of time dimension, crowd flow, weather, and historical load all have significant impacts on load forecasting. Inspired by tensor time series, considering the structure of spatial geographic location, we propose Tensor Graph Convolutional Network for Power Load Forecasting, LoadSeer. A distance adjacency matrix is designed to represent the geographical location relationship and land use nature. A spatio-temporal processing layer integrating graph convolution module (GCN) and T-Transformer is mapped out to extract the spatio-temporal features, which are then sent to the fully connected layer to provide the refined expression. The experimental results on three public datasets, PeMSD4, PeMSD7, and PeMSD8 show that our proposed method outperforms baseline models on all indicators. To further validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we apply LoadSeer to real load data during the Asian Games in a certain city, and the results also demonstrate the superiority of our method. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-17 18:58:59","2025-11-25 14:02:42","","190337-190346","","","12","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/JEKWBH7P/Zhang et al. - 2024 - LoadSeer Exploiting Tensor Graph Convolutional Network for Power Load Forecasting With Spatio-Tempo.pdf","","#done; Convolutional networks; Graph convolutional network; Power; Spatio-temporal; graph convolutional network; Power load forecasting; Electric load forecasting; Times series; Electricity load forecasting; electricity load forecasting; spatio-temporal sequence; Spatio-temporal sequence; Temporal sequences; Tensor time series; Tensors; #forecasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Wind power prediction in advance can help formulate scheduling strategies and improve the stability of the power system. With the advent of the Industry 4.0 and the widespread application of artificial intelligence technology, artificial algorithms have been extensively used in the field of wind power prediction. To further explore the spatiotemporal correlation of every wind farm in the wind farm cluster, a temporal dynamic graph network is used to divide the wind farm farm into several sub-clusters. Then, the KAN-BiLSTM-Transformer algorithm is used to predict wind power of each wind sub-cluster.

The majority of GNNs follow the message-passing paradigm, where representations of each node are learned by recursively aggregating features of its neighbors. However, this mechanism brings severe over-smoothing and efficiency issues over high-degree graphs (HDGs), wherein most nodes have dozens (or even hundreds) of neighbors, such as social networks, transaction graphs, power grids, etc. Additionally, such graphs usually encompass rich and complex structure semantics, which are hard to capture merely by feature aggregations in GNNs. Motivated by the above limitations, we propose TADA, an efficient and effective front-mounted data augmentation framework for GNNs on HDGs. Under the hood, TADA includes two key modules: (i) feature expansion with structure embeddings, and (ii) topology- and attribute-aware graph sparsification. The former obtains augmented node features and enhanced model capacity by encoding the graph structure into high-quality structure embeddings with our highly-efficient sketching method. Further, by exploiting task-relevant features extracted from graph structures and attributes, the second module enables the accurate identification and reduction of numerous redundant/noisy edges from the input graph, thereby alleviating over-smoothing and facilitating faster feature aggregations over HDGs. Empirically, \algo considerably improves the predictive performance of mainstream GNN models on 8 real homophilic/heterophilic HDGs in terms of node classification, while achieving efficient training and inference processes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-17 18:59:00","2025-11-25 14:03:04","","1463-1473","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

In this paper, we consider the inherent relation among these power forecasts at various temporal scales and propose a Temporal Hierarchy Reconciliation Network (THReN). THReN adopts a temporal hierarchical structure to generate coherent multi-site forecasts for various temporal scales. It integrates base forecasts and reconciliation processes in a trainable architecture that effectively captures both intra-level spatio-temporal correlations and inter-level temporal dependencies for a set of distributed PV stations. With a temporal hierarchy matrix S, THReN ensures prediction coherence while enhancing forecasting accuracy at multiple scales.

First, each power system requires individual training of NN detectors to accommodate its unique configuration and base demands. Second, significant changes within the power system, such as the introduction of new substations or new generators, necessitate retraining. To overcome these issues, we introduce a novel architecture, the Nodal Graph Convolutional Neural Network (NGCN), which utilizes graph convolutions at each bus and its neighborhoods. This approach allows the training process to encompass multiple power systems and include all buses, thereby enhancing the transferability of the method across different power systems. The NGCN is particularly effective for detection tasks, such as cyber-attacks on smart inverters and false data injection attacks. Our tests demonstrate that the NGCN significantly improves performance over traditional NNs, boosting detection accuracy from approximately 85% to around 97% for the aforementioned task. Furthermore, the transferable NGCN, which is trained by samples from multiple power systems, performs considerably better in evaluations than the NGCN trained on a single power system. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-17 18:59:00","2025-11-25 21:48:02","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Annu.

Hence, real-time demand-side carbon emission monitoring (DCEM), indicating the amount of carbon emission that each electricity consumer should be responsible for, becomes a necessity for the operation of the carbon emission market. However, the real-time DCEM cannot be achieved by carbon emission flow (CEF) analysis due to the unavailability of real-time power demand data. In this connection, this paper proposes a two-stage real-time DCEM method based on the graph neural network (GNN). In the first stage, power system operating scenario data, including the power generation capacity and power demand data, are collected to calculate carbon emission patterns through CEF analysis. In the second stage, a data-driven GNN-based model is designed to learn from historical daily carbon emission patterns and then realize accurate real-time DCEM with real-time available generation-side measurements only.

This paper proposes a wind speed forecasting method STGATN based on spatial dependency, which effectively reduces uncertainties caused by randomness, fluctuation, and spatial heterogeneity when capturing spatial dependencies between areas, thereby improving prediction accuracy. First, the geospatial continuous field is appropriately converted into discrete computational units that preserve topological relations. Second, a self-attention mechanism captures complex spatial dependency patterns between areas caused by factors such as terrain and surface pressure, breaking through the limitations of traditional methods that rely solely on spatial distance. Finally, a spatiotemporal graph attention neural network is designed to effectively extract and fuse spatiotemporal features, balancing time series trends and cycles with spatial dependency.

Hence, a data-driven method is proposed in this study, combining graph convolution network and long short-term memory network (GCN–LSTM) to analyze the transient power angle stability by exploring the spatiotemporal disturbance characteristics of future power systems with high penetration of renewable energy sources (wind and solar energy) and power electronics. The key time-series electrical state quantities are considered as the initial input feature quantities and normalized using the Z-score, whereas the network adjacency matrix is constructed according to the system network topology. The normalized feature quantities and network adjacency matrix were used as the inputs of the GCN to obtain the spatial features, reflecting changes in the network topology. Subsequently, the spatial features are inputted into the LSTM network to obtain the temporal features, reflecting dynamic changes in the transient power angle of the generators. Finally, the spatiotemporal features are fused through a fully connected network to analyze the transient power angle stability of future power systems, and the softmax activation cross-entropy loss functions are used to predict the stability of the samples. The proposed transient power angle stability assessment method is tested on a 500 kV AC-DC practical power system, and the simulation results show that the proposed method could effectively mine the spatiotemporal disturbance characteristics of power systems.

Accurate performance prediction is essential for enhancing system reliability and efficiency. Traditional modeling approaches rely on complex physical models or empirical formulas, which are difficult to adapt to variable operating conditions and complex circuit topologies. In recent years, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, data-driven methods have been applied to the performance modeling of power converters. However, existing data-driven methods still have many deficiencies in terms of generalization capability, computational cost and model interpretability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Graph Neural Networks (GNN) -based modeling method for power converters, which achieves accurate prediction of the dynamic performance of power converters by efficiently capturing the complex nonlinear relationships within the circuits by utilizing GNN and Multi-Layer Perceptron. This study applies this method to model the current stress of the LC-type resonant dual active bridge and compares it with other commonly used AI algorithms. The proposed modeling method can be generalized to a wide range of operating conditions, with mean absolute percentage error of less than 1% when applied to out-of-domain scenarios, compared to models that are specifically trained for those conditions. 1-kW hardware experiments comprehensively validate the feasibility of the proposed method for performance modeling. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2025","2025-11-17 18:59:00","2025-11-25 21:48:02","","105-113","","","1395 LNEE","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

The power system security has been monitored through real-time contingency analysis and dynamic security assessment framework, both of which are typically based on time-domain simulations or power flow calculations. Achieving higher accuracy in grid health level prediction often requires time-consuming simulation and analysis. To improve computational efficiency, this paper develops machine learning models with phasor measurement unit (PMU) data to monitor the power system health index, focusing on rotor angle stability and frequency stability. The proposed machine learning models accurately predict frequency and angle stability indicators, essential for evaluating grid health considering various contingencies, even when dealing with limited PMU deployment in transmission grids. The proposed framework leverages a physics-informed graph convolution network and graph attention network with ordinal encoders, which are benchmarked with multi-layer perceptron models. These models are trained on dataset derived from an augmented IEEE 118-bus system with different demand levels and fuel mix, including tailored dynamic generator models, generator controller models, and grid protection models. The numerical studies explored the performance of the proposed and baseline machine learning models under both full PMU coverage and various partial PMU coverage conditions, where different data imputation methods are used for substations without PMUs.

The traditional approach to such monitoring, Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA), has been grounded in gas volume fraction ratio analysis-a technique that, while effective, is constrained by static thresholds and simplistic assumptions that often do not encapsulate the intricacies of fault progression. In light of these limitations, the exploration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodologies presents a compelling alternative, offering a dynamic and data-driven avenue for fault detection and diagnosis. This paper proposes a transformer fault diagnosis method based on the Gramian Angular Field (GAF) transformation and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). Firstly, the one-dimensional DGA fault samples are converted into three-dimensional DGA feature image samples using the Gramian Angular Field transformation method. Then, a dataset expansion is performed on the image samples using a GAN-based data augmentation method to meet the data volume input requirements of the deep learning model. Subsequently, a graph convolutional network based on GCN layers and a Self-Attention Graph Pooling (SAGPool) mechanism is constructed. This network aggregates neighbor nodes according to the node features and topological structure of the three-dimensional DGA graph signal to adaptively mine fault features and diagnose fault types. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper can serve as an effective transformer fault diagnosis method. It is more accurate compared to the traditional gas ratio method for diagnosis, and its advantages are more significant compared to other traditional fault diagnosis deep learning methods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-17 18:59:14","2025-11-25 21:48:14","","","","","13159","","","","","","","","SPIE","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/2HSFY5X4/Zhang et al. - 2024 - Transformer Fault Diagnosis Method Based on Gramian Angular Field and Graph Convolution Network.pdf","","#done; Convolutional neural networks; Convolutional networks; Graph convolutional network; Deep learning; Convolution; Topology; Learning systems; deep learning; fault diagnosis; graph convolutional network; Power transformer; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Faults diagnosis; Power transformers; Fault diagnosis method; Angular field; Dissolved gases analysis; Gramian angular field; Gramians; Transformer fault diagnosis; #faults-reliability","","Mokhlis, H.; Siano, P.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the scarcity of high-quality fault data, prevailing methods for diagnosing power transformer faults rely on a copious amount of health data, which considerably exceeds the quantity of fault data, in an effort to enhance diagnostic accuracy. However, this approach encounters a significant challenge due to the highly imbalanced nature of the data (i.e., a predominant proportion of health data), which causes minimal variation in the gradient of classifiers during the training phase under conventional loss functions. Simply, the classifier only needs to predict health to achieve high accuracy rates. In this paper, we propose a novel method for diagnosis based on the graph convolutional network combining counterfactual analysis. Specifically, we employ the structural causal model to dissociate the direct causal effect of sample quantity on predictions from the total causal effect. We evaluate our proposed method on the data set comprising 10113 health samples and 1127 fault samples. The experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates the detrimental impact of data imbalance and utilizes health samples to enhance the accuracy of transformer fault diagnosis, particularly in scenarios where fault data is scarce. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2024","2025-11-17 18:59:16","2025-11-25 21:48:14","","85-90","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Int.

Compared with the power prediction of individual PV power plants, distributed PV cluster prediction is more challenging. In order to improve the accuracy of distributed PV cluster power prediction, this paper considers the spatio-temporal correlation between distributed PV stations and proposes a method of distributed PV cluster power prediction based on representative stations selection and Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN). Firstly, the representative station is selected by using the integrated correlation coefficient as an evaluation index through the principle of maximum correlation-minimum redundancy. Then the weight of each representative power station is calculated using the Secretary Bird Optimisation Algorithm (SBOA). STGCN is used to predict the power of PV power plants considering spatial correlation, and finally the cluster predicted power will be obtained.

Furthermore, we discuss how this modification influences the expressivity and identify sets of non-isomorphic graphs that can be discriminated by flow attention but not by standard attention.

However, existing methods encounter challenges in fault detection accuracy, limited fault type coverage, and scalability, issues exacerbated by increasing renewable integration, and practical data noise. This paper proposes a deep graph attention network (GAT) for detecting and managing fault events on distribution systems, addressing above the first two limitations. Our proposed one-dimensional GAT leverages spatial and temporal data more effectively than traditional data-driven methods. High-accuracy μPMU measurements are exploited as multi-dimensional attributes to enhance feature representation. The validation results on two test systems show that the proposed method improves fault event detection accuracy by 1%–2%, fault type classification by 4%, and fault localization by 5%. Additionally, the method demonstrates improved robustness under noise conditions, achieving a 1.3% to 3% improvement over traditional methods as noise levels increase from 3% to 10%.","2024-09-05","2025-11-17 23:07:42","2025-11-25 14:02:53","2025-11-17 23:07:42","","","","","","","","","","","","Preprints","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/EKICV7CF/Ngo et al. - 2024 - Deep Graph Neural Network for Fault Detection and Identification in Distribution Systems.pdf","","#done; #faults-reliability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The recent works show the application of graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn state to object-centric embedding and achieve centralized block-wise computation of the Koopman operator (KO) under additional assumptions on the underlying node properties and constraints on the KO structure. However, the computational complexity of learning the Koopman operator increases for large NDS. Moreover, the computational complexity increases in a combinatorial fashion with the increase in number of nodes. The learning challenge is further ampliﬁed for sparse networks by two factors: 1) sample sparsity for learning the Koopman operator in the non-linear space, and 2) the dissimilarity in the dynamics of individual nodes or from one subgraph to another. Our work aims to address these challenges by formulating the representation learning of NDS into a multi-agent paradigm and learning the Koopman operator in a distributive manner. Our theoretical results show that the proposed distributed computation of the geometric Koopman operator is beneﬁcial for sparse NDS, whereas for the fully connected systems this approach coincides with the centralized one. The empirical study on a rope system, a network of oscillators, and a power grid show comparable and superior performance along with computational beneﬁts with the state-of-the-art methods.","","2025-11-17 23:07:55","2025-11-25 17:31:22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/gs8758/Zotero/storage/LL8LAX42/Mukherjee et al. - Learning Distributed Geometric Koopman Operator for Sparse Networked Dynamical Systems.pdf","","#done; #methodology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This helps power companies plan their power generation effectively. Additionally, it aids in allocating power resources wisely. Thus power companies ensure that the supply capacity meets the demand. This prevents power shortages or overloads caused by supply and demand imbalances. This paper proposes a spatio-temporal graph information-based load forecasting method that extracts and analyzes the spatio-temporal correlation properties of the graph information by converting timeseries data into Markov field graph information and using a multivariate spatio-temporal graph neural network. Electric load data from Fuzeyuan District in Yuxi City, Yunnan Province, is used to confirm the forecasting method's viability and accuracy. The findings demonstrate that the approach can improve load forecasting outcomes.","2025-06-01","2025-11-17 23:21:10","2025-11-25 14:02:42","2025-11-17 23:21:10","012023","","1","3012","","J.
